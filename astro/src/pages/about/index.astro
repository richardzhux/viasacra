  <h1>Welcome to Richard’s Forum</h1>
  <p>The name Via Sacra (“Sacred Way”) is borrowed from ancient Rome’s triumphal avenue: it set out from the Field of Mars, wound past the Circus Maximus and Colosseum, ducked beneath the Arches of Titus and Constantine, crossed the Imperial Fora, then finally ascended to the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline. Victories were celebrated there, but the stones also kept score of every stumble. The path was grit followed by clarity.</p>
  <p>This site is my own Via Sacra. It gathers sketches of law, science, and art, trying to braid intellect with empathy, precision with wonder. Projects live here because they taught me something about coherence, even when the experiments failed.</p>
  <p>My hope is that you find a spark for your own campaign, and more importantly carve out a life that feels joyful in the process.</p>

  <h2>🌿 About Me</h2>
  <p>I’m Richard, a legal thinker, physicist, and wanderer between disciplines. My work explores how intelligence, justice, and beauty can coexist, from courtrooms to algorithms, from starlight to data. I move fluidly between law and science, building bridges between reasoning and empathy, structure and freedom.</p>
  <p>I care about systems that reveal truth without losing humanity, and about creating tools and ideas that help people see the world more clearly. Via Sacra is my personal observatory, part laboratory, part journal on what it means to think, to feel, and to build with conscience.</p>
  <p>Around here you can dive into Projects for build logs and research experiments, wander Random for notebooks and field notes, slip into Lux for photography studies, detour through Meditations for essays, and follow Travel for the maps and telemetry that keep me moving. Make yourself at home, explore the instruments, and see what stories they might spark for you.</p>
