SCOTUS Strike Down a Law for Vagueness <em>Alone</em>?</h3>
<p>✅ <strong>Yes.</strong> Even if a law doesn’t violate a specific
enumerated right (like speech or religion), it can be struck down for
being <strong>so vague</strong> that it <strong>violates due
process</strong> by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failing to give <strong>fair notice</strong></li>
<li>Enabling <strong>arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Doctrine: <strong>Void for Vagueness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rooted in <strong>Procedural Due Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>5A</strong> (federal laws)</li>
<li><strong>14A</strong> (state laws)</li>

<p>In practice, a private party’s conduct becomes “state action” if any
one of these is true:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Legislative or regulatory</strong>: A government statute or
regulation directly compels or authorizes the conduct.</li>
<li><strong>Official actor</strong>: A government official, acting under
color of law, participates in or enforces the conduct.</li>
<li><strong>Public function / entanglement</strong>: The private party
is (a) performing a function traditionally and exclusively done by the
government, or (b) so entwined with the government (leases, licensing,
subsidy, symbiosis) that its actions are fairly attributable to the
State. The cases below sit along a <strong>spectrum of
entanglement</strong>—from absolute state action (courts enforcing
covenants) to clear non‑action (mere licensing).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>State action doctrine is a "conceptual disaster area" and theories
about it are a "torch-less search for a way out of a damp echoing
cave."</li>
<li>Any state enforcement or delegation of discriminatory practices
violates the Constitution—regardless of whether the discrimination
originated with the state or a private party.</li>

Kraemer</strong>, 334 U.S. 1 (1948)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
 – Private homeowners’ association in St. Louis had racially restrictive
covenants forbidding sale to “any person not of the Caucasian
race.”<br />
 – The Shelleys (Black) bought a house; neighbors (Kraemers) sued in
state court to enforce the covenant.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shelley’s argument?</strong><br />
 – Judicial enforcement of the covenant is “state action” under the
Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kraemer’s argument?</strong><br />
 – Covenants are purely private agreements; enforcement by state courts
is ministerial, not “action” under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
 – <strong>Yes</strong>: When a court enforces a racially discriminatory
covenant, that enforcement is state action—and it violates Equal
Protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
 – <em>Ex parte Virginia</em>, 100 U.S. 339 (1880), on enforcing
discrimination as state action;<br />
 – <em>The Civil Rights Cases</em>, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), crafting the
state‑action principle;<br />
 – Early Equal Protection decisions on judicial enforcement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
 – Fourteenth Amendment, § 1 (“No State shall… deny to any person… equal
protection of the laws.”)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concurrences:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justice Murphy:</strong> Racial covenants are “inherently
repugnant to the free society” and violate due process as well as equal
protection.</li>
<li><strong>Justice Jackson:</strong> Emphasized that a judicial
decree—even to effect a private contract—transforms that contract into
state action.</li>
<li><strong>Justice Burton:</strong> Focused on the enforcement
machinery itself: “the state cannot be a party to a private wrong.”</li>

 – A municipally owned parking authority leased ground‑floor space to
the Eagle Coffee Shop, which refused service to James Irvis, an
African‑American.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Irvis’s argument?</strong><br />
 – The close financial and structural “symbiosis” between the Parking
Authority and the restaurant makes the restaurant’s conduct state action
under Equal Protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Authority’s/Restaurant’s argument?</strong><br />
 – The restaurant is privately owned; discrimination in its seating
policy is private, not attributable to the State.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
 – <strong>Yes</strong>: Because the Authority granted exclusive lease,
provided utilities, and shared profits, the restaurant’s discriminatory
policy is fairly attributable to the State.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
 – <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em> (326 U.S. 501 (1946))—private company town

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
 – Moose Lodge, a private fraternal organization in Pennsylvania,
excluded Black members. Plaintiff Irvis was denied a drink. The State
requires all liquor‑license applicants—public or private—to obtain a
state permit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Irvis’s argument?</strong><br />
 – That state licensing of all establishments, including Moose Lodge,
creates sufficient state action to invoke Equal Protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Moose Lodge’s argument?</strong><br />
 – Licensing is a neutral, general regulation; membership and service
policies remain purely private choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
 – <strong>No</strong>: A mere state license, without more direct
regulation or support, does not make private discrimination “state
action.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
 – <em>Burton v. Wilmington</em>—symbiotic entanglement test;<br />
 – <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em>—public function test;<br />

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissents:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Justice Brennan (joined by Justice Marshall &amp; Justice
Douglas):</strong> Maintained that the state’s power to revoke the

to treat Moose Lodge’s discrimination as state action.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Private parade/assembly:</strong> If organized entirely
by private individuals (no state sponsorship, no permit conditions), the
organizer may exclude on any basis (race, gender, ideology) without
running afoul of the First or Fourteenth Amendments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State involvement test:</strong> If the parade uses
public streets under a state‑issued permit that conditions
non‑discrimination, or if the organizer receives special government
funding, then exclusion may be state action and trigger strict scrutiny
(e.g., <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware</em> analogies).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Burton</em> stands for the principle that
<strong>public-private partnerships come with constitutional
baggage</strong>. If a government agency creates an appearance of unity
with a private actor—physically (shared doors), financially (shared
rent/utilities), or operationally (shared public services)—then the
<strong>private actor inherits the state's constitutional
obligations.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The Court <strong>doesn’t require ==actual knowledge or direct
control</strong>==—just that the <strong>state put itself in a position
where discrimination could flourish on public grounds.</strong> The
closer the physical and economic entanglement, the heavier the
constitutional burden.</p></li>

<li><p>Distinction between <em>Burton</em> and <em>Moose Lodge</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Moose Lodge</em>, the Court <strong>narrows the concept of
entanglement</strong>. Merely having a <strong>state liquor
license</strong> is not enough to make a private club’s actions
<strong>state action</strong> under the Fourteenth Amendment.</li>
<li>The distinction hinges on <strong>mutual benefit and
integration</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In <em>Burton</em>, the state and the lessee were
<strong>symbiotically linked</strong>—sharing profits, facilities, and
utilities.</li>
<li>In <em>Moose Lodge</em>, the state’s involvement was <strong>general
and regulatory</strong>, not <strong>specific or supportive</strong> of
the discriminatory practice.</li>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Always map: (1) <strong>Who</strong> is acting? (2) <strong>Under

</blockquote>
<p>Using IRAC when analyzing a state action question:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue</strong>: Is the private party’s conduct subject to

<ul>
<li>Legislative law is <strong>explicit, prospective</strong>, and
subject to democratic checks.</li>
<li>Judicial doctrine is <strong>interpretive, precedential</strong>,
and can look like "law about law."</li>
<li>It can be <strong>passive</strong> (just choosing a framework like

<li>The legitimacy of doctrine depends on whether courts are

<h3 id="ii-due-process--fundamental-rights">II. Due Process &amp;
Fundamental Rights</h3>
<p>The <strong>Due Process Clause</strong> (5th and 14th Amendments)
guarantees more than procedural fairness—it also protects certain
<strong>substantive liberties</strong> from government interference,
even with “due process.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💬 "Liberty" = <strong>Certain interests so central to autonomy and
dignity</strong> that <strong>government can’t infringe</strong> them
without extraordinary justification. 🛑 But: Rights are <strong>not
absolute</strong>. A "fundamental" right <strong>triggers
scrutiny</strong>, not immunity. Rights are always context and extent
dependent.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When courts recognize a new right, they <strong>remove it from
democratic politics</strong>—they’re saying, <em>“You can no longer vote
to restrict this.”</em></li>
<li>That’s why <strong>due process rights are mostly negative</strong>:
they <strong>block</strong> the government from doing things, rather
than requiring it to <strong>affirmatively</strong> provide things
(e.g., housing, health care).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Substantive Due Process Doctrine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to the earlier table detailing three levels of scrutiny</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Case: <em>Washington v. Glucksberg</em> (1997)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facts:</strong> Washington state banned physician-assisted
suicide. Plaintiffs claimed the ban violated a constitutional
<strong>liberty interest</strong> in controlling one’s death.</li>
<li><strong>Issue:</strong> Does the Due Process Clause protect the
right to physician-assisted suicide?</li>
<li><strong>Holding (Chief Justice Rehnquist, Majority):</strong>
<strong>No.</strong> The right to assisted suicide is <strong>not a
fundamental liberty interest</strong> protected by the
Constitution.</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Two-step test for new fundamental rights</strong>:
<ul>
<li>(1) Is the right <strong>deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and
tradition</strong>?</li>
<li>(2) Is it <strong>implicit in the concept of ordered
liberty</strong>?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Court emphasized <strong>judicial restraint</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Warned against expanding substantive due process without historical
foundation.</li>
<li>Framed itself as deferring to democratic debate and <strong>state
experimentation</strong>.</li>

<h3 id="1-lochner-v-new-york-198-us-45-1905">1. Lochner v. New York, 198
U.S. 45 (1905)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– A New York law limited bakers to working no more than 60 hours per
week or 10 hours per day. A bakery owner was fined for violating it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lochner’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law violated his and his workers’ <strong>liberty of
contract</strong>, protected by the <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>
of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New York’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law served the public interest by protecting the health and safety
of bakers, a legitimate exercise of the state's <strong>police
powers</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes</strong>: The Court struck down the law, holding that it
<strong>unreasonably interfered</strong> with freedom of contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
– Earlier substantive due process and economic liberty cases, though the
Court heavily relied on its own balancing of liberty vs. police
power.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
– Fourteenth Amendment, <strong>Due Process Clause</strong> (substantive
interpretation).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– Right to enter into employment contracts without excessive state
interference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State action?</strong><br />
– New York labor statute limiting work hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– Not formally articulated, but effectively <strong>strict
scrutiny</strong> for economic liberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– A hallmark of the <strong>Lochner era</strong>, where the Court used
<strong>substantive due process</strong> to strike down economic
regulations. Later heavily criticized as judicial overreach and
overturned in spirit by <em>West Coast Hotel</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-meyer-v-nebraska-262-us-390-1923">2. Meyer v. Nebraska, 262
U.S. 390 (1923)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Nebraska law prohibited teaching modern foreign languages (like
German) to students before 8th grade. Meyer, a teacher, taught German to
a student and was convicted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Meyer’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law violated his and the parent’s <strong>liberty</strong> under
the Fourteenth Amendment, including the rights to <strong>teach, learn,
and direct a child’s education</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nebraska’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law served the public welfare by promoting civic unity and English
literacy in post-WWI America.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes</strong>: The Court struck down the law as <strong>an
arbitrary interference with individual liberty</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
– Early substantive due process decisions and common-law traditions of
parental rights and personal liberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
– Fourteenth Amendment, <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– Rights of parents to control their children’s education; right of
individuals to teach and learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State action?</strong><br />
– State statute restricting curriculum content in private schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– Not formally tiered, but applied a <strong>heightened (quasi-strict)
scrutiny</strong> based on liberty interference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– Expanded <strong>substantive due process beyond economics</strong> to
include <strong>cultural and educational autonomy</strong>. Helped lay
groundwork for later privacy and parental rights cases.</p>

<h3 id="3-williamson-v-lee-optical-348-us-483-1955">3. Williamson v. Lee
Optical, 348 U.S. 483 (1955)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Oklahoma law made it illegal for opticians to fit lenses without a
prescription from an ophthalmologist or optometrist. A business
challenged the law as irrational.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Williamson’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law was <strong>economically protectionist</strong> and served no
rational purpose, thus violating the <strong>Due Process
Clause</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law could promote public eye health, even if indirectly, and the
legislature has wide discretion to regulate professions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>No</strong>: The Court upheld the law, even if it was
“needless” or “wasteful,” because it met the <strong>rational
basis</strong> test.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
– Post-Lochner cases like <em>Nebbia v. New York</em> (1934) and
<em>West Coast Hotel</em> that upheld economic regulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
– Fourteenth Amendment, <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– Economic liberty: the right to operate a business without arbitrary
regulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State action?</strong><br />
– State regulation governing optician practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– <strong>Rational basis</strong>—law presumed valid if any conceivable
purpose exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– Cemented <strong>judicial deference to economic regulation</strong>,
marking a full rejection of <strong>Lochner-era activism</strong>. The
law does not have to be wise—just <strong>not irrational</strong>.</p>

Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500 (1964)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Under the Subversive Activities Control Act, the Secretary of State
denied passports to members of the Communist Party. Aptheker, a U.S.
citizen and party official, was barred from foreign travel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aptheker’s argument?</strong><br />
– The passport denial violated his <strong>liberty to travel
internationally</strong> under the <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>,
and it was an overbroad infringement based on <strong>guilt by
association</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Government’s argument?</strong><br />
– National security justified restricting travel by individuals
associated with subversive organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes</strong>: The statute was <strong>facially
unconstitutional</strong> because it <strong>swept too broadly</strong>,
applying to all party members regardless of their individual
conduct.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
– <em>Kent v. Dulles</em> (1958) on the right to travel; First and Fifth
Amendment associational and liberty protections.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
– Fifth Amendment <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>, with implications
from the First Amendment’s freedom of association.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– Right to <strong>international travel</strong> and freedom of
political association.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State action?</strong><br />
– Federal statute enforced by executive agency (State Department).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– Effectively <strong>heightened scrutiny</strong>—not labeled “strict,”
but Court looked for tailoring to compelling interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– Reaffirmed that <strong>liberty interests can’t be infringed by overly
broad laws</strong>, especially where <strong>associational
rights</strong> are implicated. Imposed limits on executive power in
national security contexts.</p>

West Coast Hotel v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– A Washington state minimum wage law for women was challenged by a
hotel owner who claimed it violated freedom of contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Parrish’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law served the public interest and addressed harmful labor
practices; economic liberty was not absolute.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hotel’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law infringed on the employer’s and employee’s <strong>freedom of
contract</strong>, violating due process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>No</strong>: The Court upheld the law, explicitly rejecting
the <strong>Lochner</strong> approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
– Overruled Lochner implicitly; relied on <strong>Nebbia v. New
York</strong> (1934).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
– Fourteenth Amendment <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– Economic liberty: right to negotiate wages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>State action?</strong><br />
– State labor law mandating minimum wages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– <strong>Rational basis</strong>—deferential review of economic
legislation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– Marked the <strong>end of the Lochner era</strong>, launching the
<strong>modern doctrine of deference to legislatures</strong> in
economic regulation.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="1-griswold-v-connecticut-381-us-479-1965">1. Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Connecticut criminalized the use of contraceptives, even by married
couples. Estelle Griswold, Director of Planned Parenthood, was convicted
for providing them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Griswold’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law violated the <strong>right to privacy</strong> in marital
relations. Cited <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma</em> (1942): <strong>marriage
and procreation</strong> are fundamental to liberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Connecticut’s argument?</strong><br />
– The statute protected <strong>public morality</strong>, discouraging
<strong>premarital sex</strong> and preserving social norms.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes</strong>: The law was unconstitutional. The Court held
that <strong>marital privacy is a protected liberty</strong>, found in
the <strong>“penumbras” of specific Bill of Rights
guarantees</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
– <em>Skinner</em>, <em>Meyer</em>, <em>Pierce</em>, and selective
incorporation doctrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
– Majority (Douglas): Privacy comes from <strong>1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and
9th Amendments</strong>. Not due process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– Right of <strong>marital privacy</strong> in intimate decisions about
contraception.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State action?</strong><br />
– Connecticut’s criminal statute punishing use and counseling of
contraceptives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– Implicitly <strong>strict scrutiny</strong>—though no tiered language
yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concurring opinions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goldberg</strong>: Relied on <strong>9th Amendment</strong>,
“retained rights” of the people.</li>
<li><strong>Harlan</strong>: Located privacy in the <strong>14th
Amendment's Due Process Clause</strong>, rooted in tradition and ordered
liberty.</li>
<li><strong>White</strong>: Saw no compelling interest justifying
intrusion into intimate decisions. Applied <strong>substantive due
process</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black</strong>: Warned against judicial overreach. No
textual “right to privacy.”</li>
<li><strong>Stewart</strong>: Called the law “uncommonly silly” but
<strong>constitutionally valid</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– Created the <strong>modern right to privacy</strong>, forming the
basis for later decisions on contraception, abortion, sexuality, and
family life. Redefined how courts identify <strong>unenumerated
rights</strong>.</p>

(1973)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Texas banned abortion except to save the mother’s life. Jane Roe (a
pseudonym) challenged the law as unconstitutional.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roe’s argument?</strong><br />
– The abortion ban violated her <strong>right to privacy and bodily
autonomy</strong>, grounded in <strong>substantive due
process</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Texas’s argument?</strong><br />
– Asserted three compelling interests:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Moral preservation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Protection of potential life</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maternal health and medical integrity</strong></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes</strong>: The Court struck down the ban, recognizing
<strong>abortion as a fundamental right</strong> under the
<strong>liberty component of the 14th Amendment Due Process
Clause</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
– <em>Griswold</em>, <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird</em>, <em>Skinner</em>,
<em>Meyer</em>, <em>Pierce</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
– Fourteenth Amendment, <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– Right to terminate a pregnancy as part of <strong>personal bodily
autonomy</strong> and family life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State action?</strong><br />
– Texas criminal abortion statute.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– <strong>Strict scrutiny</strong>: State must show compelling interest
and narrow tailoring.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Trimester Framework (created by the Court):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st trimester</strong>: State has <strong>no
interest</strong> to interfere.</li>
<li><strong>2nd trimester</strong>: State may regulate for
<strong>maternal health</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>3rd trimester</strong>: State may regulate or
<strong>prohibit abortion</strong>, except when mother’s life/health is
at risk.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– <em>Roe</em> defined <strong>abortion as a constitutional
right</strong> and shaped 50 years of reproductive law. Created a
sweeping judicial doctrine, yet also provoked <strong>intense
backlash</strong> for being <strong>doctrinally ambitious</strong>.</p>

Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992)</h3>

<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Pennsylvania law imposed restrictions on abortion: informed consent,
24-hour waiting period, parental consent for minors, and <strong>spousal
notification</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Planned Parenthood’s argument?</strong><br />
– These requirements <strong>unduly burdened</strong> the right to
choose abortion, violating <em>Roe</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania’s argument?</strong><br />
– Claimed the law supported <strong>informed decision-making</strong>
and <strong>respect for fetal life</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes and No</strong>: <em>Roe</em> was reaffirmed, but the
<strong>trimester framework was replaced</strong>. The Court upheld most
provisions <strong>except</strong> the <strong>spousal
notification</strong>, which it deemed an <strong>undue
burden</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
– <em>Roe</em>, <em>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health</em>,
<em>Thornburgh</em>.</p>

– Fourteenth Amendment <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– Right to abortion as part of <strong>bodily autonomy and personal
decision-making</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>State action?</strong><br />
– Pennsylvania’s abortion regulation statute.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– <strong>INTRODUCED the Undue Burden Test to REPLACE Strict
Scrutiny</strong>: A law is unconstitutional if it places a
<strong>substantial obstacle</strong> in the path of a woman seeking an
abortion <strong>before fetal viability</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Joint opinion (O’Connor, Kennedy, Souter):</strong><br />
– Reaffirmed <em>Roe</em>'s “essential holding” on the
<strong>constitutional right</strong>, but <strong>retreated from strict
scrutiny</strong> in favor of <strong>functional burden
analysis</strong>.<br />
– Emphasized <strong>stare decisis</strong>: Legal stability matters
even amid controversy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– <em>Casey</em> preserved abortion rights but narrowed them. It
<strong>institutionalized the "undue burden" standard</strong>, which
would be pivotal in future litigation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Mississippi law banned abortions after <strong>15 weeks</strong>,
directly challenging the <strong>viability line</strong> of <em>Roe</em>
and <em>Casey</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jackson Women’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law was clearly <strong>unconstitutional under Casey</strong>,
which protected pre-viability abortion access.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mississippi’s argument?</strong><br />
– Urged the Court to <strong>overrule Roe and Casey</strong>, arguing
abortion is <strong>not a deeply rooted right</strong> and should be
left to the states.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>No</strong> constitutional right to abortion. Both
<em>Roe</em> and <em>Casey</em> were <strong>overruled</strong>. The
Court returned authority to the states.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court overruled?</strong><br />
– Explicitly overruled <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and <em>Planned Parenthood
v. Casey</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
– Fourteenth Amendment <strong>does not protect abortion</strong>,
majority says.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– <strong>Not recognized</strong>. Court said abortion is <strong>not
deeply rooted</strong> in American tradition or history.</p>

– Mississippi statute banning abortion after 15 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– <strong>Rational basis review</strong> now applies to abortion
laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Majority (Alito):</strong><br />
– Denounced Roe as “egregiously wrong from the start.”<br />
– Rejected substantive due process for unenumerated rights not rooted in
<strong>history and tradition</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concurring (Thomas):</strong><br />
– Suggested reconsidering other substantive due process precedents
(<em>Griswold</em>, <em>Lawrence</em>, <em>Obergefell</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissent (Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan):</strong><br />
– Condemned the majority for destroying a liberty <strong>central to
women’s autonomy and equality</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– <strong>Most radical rollback of a constitutional right in modern
history</strong>. Reignited the <strong>abortion-rights political
fight</strong> and redefined the limits of <strong>substantive due

Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942) — Bonus Case</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Oklahoma’s Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act allowed forced
sterilization of certain repeat offenders. Jack Skinner was ordered
sterilized after three theft convictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Skinner’s argument?</strong><br />
– The law violated his <strong>equal protection</strong> and infringed a
<strong>fundamental liberty</strong>: the right to
<strong>procreate</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Oklahoma’s argument?</strong><br />
– Argued sterilization served <strong>eugenic goals</strong> and
targeted only certain “degenerate” traits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes</strong>: The law was struck down. Procreation is a
<strong>fundamental right</strong>, and the law’s <strong>arbitrary
targeting</strong> of some crimes (but not white-collar crimes) violated
<strong>equal protection</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents the Court looked to?</strong><br />
– <em>Buck v. Bell</em> (1927)—implicitly retreated from it without

<p><strong>Constitutional provisions?</strong><br />
– Fourteenth Amendment <strong>Equal Protection Clause</strong>, with

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberty interest?</strong><br />
– <strong>Fundamental right to procreate</strong>, as part of human

– Oklahoma’s criminal sterilization statute.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– Not named, but effectively <strong>strict scrutiny</strong> due to
fundamental right.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
– Laid the groundwork for <strong>privacy, reproductive rights</strong>,
and later <strong>substantive due process jurisprudence</strong>
(<em>Griswold</em>, <em>Roe</em>). First explicit recognition that
<strong>bodily autonomy and reproduction</strong> are fundamental
constitutional concerns.</p>

<p>Because they are:</p>

<li>One of the <strong>most prominent providers of abortion

stages.</p>

– These provisions were designed not to promote safety, but to
<strong>deter abortion</strong>, violating the substantive due process
rights recognized in <em>Roe</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Akron’s argument?</strong><br />
– Claimed the requirements promoted <strong>informed
decision-making</strong>, <strong>protect fetal life</strong>, and

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
– Whether these <strong>procedural and physical burdens</strong> on
abortion access were consistent with <em>Roe’s</em> protections.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes, the law was unconstitutional</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>24-hour delay</strong> = invalid, as it served <strong>no

<li><strong>Hospital-only rule</strong> = struck down;

<h3 id="ii-aclu-comment-on-laken-riley-act">II. ACLU Comment on Laken
Riley Act</h3>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li><strong>Mandatory Detention Without Charge or
Hearing</strong>:<br />
The Act mandates detention of any noncitizen who <strong>admits to
having committed conduct that constitutes the essential
elements</strong> of burglary, theft, larceny, or
shoplifting—<strong>regardless of whether they were ever charged,
arrested, or convicted</strong> in any jurisdiction. This
<strong>pre-criminal, hearsay-based detention regime</strong> raises
grave <strong>due process concerns</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>No Hearing, No Judge, No Charge—Just Indefinite
Detention</strong>:<br />
The Act allows detention even where <strong>an immigration judge
expressly disagrees</strong>, and without requiring any arrest or formal
adjudication. Such authority <strong>circumvents core procedural
protections</strong> guaranteed under the <strong>Fifth Amendment's Due
Process Clause</strong>, and resembles detention schemes
<strong>previously invalidated</strong> by the Supreme Court (<em>Hamdi
v. Rumsfeld</em>, <em>Foucha v. Louisiana</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Expansive, Vague, and Unconstitutional</strong>:<br />
The language is <strong>overbroad</strong>, covering vague “admissions”
and conduct from any jurisdiction, regardless of legal definitions or
cultural context. Such vagueness <strong>invites arbitrary
enforcement</strong>, violates fair notice principles, and runs afoul of
the <strong>void for vagueness doctrine</strong> (<em>Papachristou v.
Jacksonville</em>, <em>Kolender v. Lawson</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Improper State Enforcement of Federal Immigration
Law</strong>:<br />
The Act grants <strong>standing and enforcement powers</strong> to
<strong>state attorneys general</strong> and other non-federal actors.
This <strong>conflicts with Supreme Court precedent</strong> that
immigration regulation is an <strong>exclusive federal function</strong>
(<em>Arizona v. United States</em>, <em>United States v. Texas</em>).
Under <em>Spokeo v. Robins</em>, Congress <strong>cannot manufacture
standing</strong> by statutory fiat without a <strong>concrete and
particularized injury</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>False "Open Border" Narrative Refuted by DHS
Data</strong>:<br />
Contrary to political rhetoric, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
data shows that <strong>immigrant removals from May to November 2023
were on par with or exceeded those from 2019</strong>, and surpassed all
totals from 2015 to 2018. <strong>Daily removals nearly doubled</strong>
compared to pre-pandemic averages (2014–2019). The notion of an "open
border" is not supported by empirical enforcement metrics.</li>

<h3 id="1-united-states-v-texas-599-us-___-2023">1. <strong>United
States v. Texas</strong> (599 U.S. ___, 2023)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facts</strong>: Texas and Louisiana challenged Biden
administration’s immigration enforcement guidelines that prioritized
deporting noncitizens who were a threat to public safety or national
security, rather than everyone eligible for removal.</li>
<li><strong>Holding</strong>: The Court dismissed for <strong>lack of
standing</strong>—states cannot sue the federal government just because
they disagree with enforcement priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Right / Principle</strong>: <strong>Article III
standing</strong> requires a concrete, judicially cognizable injury—not
a political or administrative grievance.</li>
<li><strong>Significance</strong>: Limits <strong>state
standing</strong> to challenge <strong>federal immigration
discretion</strong>. Weakens Laken Riley Act’s idea that <strong>state

immigration laws.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Facts</strong>: Yaser Hamdi, a U.S. citizen, was detained
indefinitely as an “enemy combatant” without charge or trial after being
captured in Afghanistan.</li>
<li><strong>Holding</strong>: The Court held that <strong>even enemy
combatants have due process rights</strong>. Hamdi was entitled to a
meaningful opportunity to contest his detention before a neutral
decisionmaker.</li>
<li><strong>Right / Principle</strong>: <strong>Due Process Clause
(Fifth Amendment)</strong> applies to detention, even in wartime.</li>
<li><strong>Significance</strong>: Undermines any notion that
immigrants—<strong>even noncitizens</strong>—can be detained
<strong>indefinitely and without hearing</strong>, as the Laken Riley
Act proposes.</li>

<li><strong>Facts</strong>: A man found not guilty by reason of insanity

because he was deemed dangerous.</li>
<li><strong>Holding</strong>: <strong>Indefinite civil

<li><strong>Right / Principle</strong>: <strong>Liberty

id="iii-no-theres-no-hate-speech-exception-to-the-first-amendment----eugene-volokh">III.
No, there’s no “hate speech” exception to the First Amendment -- Eugene
Volokh</h3>
<p>I keep hearing about a supposed “hate speech” exception to the First
Amendment, or statements such as, “This isn’t free speech, it’s hate
speech,” or “When does free speech stop and hate speech begin?” But
there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment. Hateful ideas
(whatever exactly that might mean) are just as protected under the First
Amendment as other ideas. One is as free to condemn Islam — or Muslims,
or Jews, or blacks, or whites, or illegal aliens, or native-born
citizens — as one is to condemn capitalism or Socialism or Democrats or
Republicans.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are some kinds of speech that are unprotected by
the First Amendment. But those narrow exceptions have nothing to do with
“hate speech” in any conventionally used sense of the term. For
instance, there is an exception for “fighting words” — face-to-face
personal insults addressed to a specific person, of the sort that are
likely to start an immediate fight. But this exception isn’t limited to
racial or religious insults, nor does it cover all racially or
religiously offensive statements. Indeed, when the City of St. Paul
tried to specifically punish bigoted fighting words, the Supreme Court
held that this selective prohibition was unconstitutional (<em>R.A.V. v.
City of St. Paul</em> (1992)), even though a broad ban on all fighting
words would indeed be permissible. (And, notwithstanding CNN anchor
Chris Cuomo’s <a
href="https://twitter.com/ChrisCuomo/status/595934009764487168">Tweet</a> that
“hate speech is excluded from protection,” and his later claims that by
“hate speech” he means “fighting words,” the fighting words exception is
not generally labeled a “hate speech” exception, and isn’t coextensive
with any established definition of “hate speech” that I know of.)</p>
<p>The same is true of the other narrow exceptions, such as for true
threats of illegal conduct or incitement intended to and likely to
produce imminent illegal conduct (i.e., illegal conduct in the next few
hours or maybe days, as opposed to some illegal conduct some time in the
future). Indeed, threatening to kill someone because he’s black (or
white), or intentionally inciting someone to a likely and immediate
attack on someone because he’s Muslim (or Christian or Jewish), can be
made a crime. But this isn’t because it’s “hate speech”; it’s because
it’s illegal to make true threats and incite imminent crimes against
anyone and for any reason, for instance because they are police officers
or capitalists or just someone who is sleeping with the speaker’s
ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court did, in <em>Beauharnais v. Illinois</em> (1952),
uphold a “group libel” law that outlawed statements that expose racial
or religious groups to contempt or hatred, unless the speaker could show
that the statements were true, and were said with “good motives” and for
“justifiable ends.” But this too was treated by the Court as just a
special case of a broader First Amendment exception — the one for libel
generally. And <em>Beauharnais</em> is widely understood to no longer be
good law, given the Court’s restrictions on the libel exception.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>See <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</em> (1964) (rejecting the
view that libel is categorically unprotected, and holding that the libel
exception requires a showing that the libelous accusations be “of and
concerning” a particular person); </p></li>
<li><p><em>Garrison v. Louisiana</em> (1964) (generally rejecting the
view that a defense of truth can be limited to speech that is said for
“good motives” and for “justifiable ends”); </p></li>
<li><p><em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps</em> (1986) (generally
rejecting the view that the burden of proving truth can be placed on the
defendant); </p></li>
<li><p><em>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul</em> (1992) (holding that singling
bigoted speech is unconstitutional, even when that speech fits within a
First Amendment exception); </p></li>

<p>Finally, “hostile environment harassment law” has sometimes been read
as applying civil liability — or administrative discipline by
universities — to allegedly bigoted speech in workplaces, universities,
and places of public accommodation. There is a hot debate on whether
those restrictions are indeed constitutional; they have generally been
held unconstitutional when applied to universities, but decisions are
mixed as to civil liability based on speech that creates hostile
environments in workplaces (see <a
href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/harass">the pages linked to at this
site</a> for more information on the subject). But even when those
restrictions have been upheld, they have been justified precisely on the
rationale that they do not criminalize speech (or otherwise punish it)
in society at large, ==but only apply to particular contexts,== such as
workplaces. ==None of them represent a “hate speech” exception, nor have
they been defined in terms of “hate speech.”==</p>
<p>For this very reason, “hate speech” also doesn’t have any fixed legal
meaning under U.S. law. U.S. law has just never had occasion to define
“hate speech” — any more than it has had occasion to define rudeness,
evil ideas, unpatriotic speech, or any other kind of speech that people
might condemn but that does not constitute a legally relevant
category.</p>
<p>Of course, one can certainly argue that First Amendment
law <em>should</em> be changed to allow bans on hate speech (whether <a
href="http://volokh.com/2012/09/13/former-yale-dean-harold-koh-now-attorney-advisor-at-the-state-department-on/">bigoted
speech</a>, <a
href="http://volokh.com/2012/10/01/organization-of-islamic-conference-head-calls-for-a-global-ban-on-offending-the-character-of-the-prophet-muhammad/">blasphemy</a>, <a
href="http://volokh.com/2012/09/13/prof-peter-spiro-on-why-hate-speech-should-be-banned-and-on-how-it-might-be-done/">blasphemy
to which foreigners may respond with attacks on Americans</a> or
blasphemy or <a
href="http://volokh.com/2009/05/14/flag-desecration-and-hate-speech/">flag
burning</a> or anything else). Perhaps some statements of the “This
isn’t free speech, it’s hate speech” variety are deliberate attempts to
call for such an exception, though my sense is that they are usually
(incorrect) claims that the exception already exists.</p>
<p>I think no such exception should be recognized, but of course, like
all questions about what the law ought to be, this is a matter that can
be debated. Indeed, people have a First Amendment right to call for
speech restrictions, just as they have a First Amendment right to call
for gun bans or bans on Islam or government-imposed race discrimination
or anything else that current constitutional law forbids. Constitutional
law is no more set in stone than any other law.</p>
<p>But those who want to make such arguments should acknowledge that
they are calling for a change in First Amendment law, and should explain
just what that change would be, so people can thoughtfully evaluate it.
Calls for a new First Amendment exception for “hate speech” shouldn’t
just rely on the undefined term “hate speech” — they should explain just
what viewpoints the government would be allowed to suppress, what
viewpoints would remain protected, and how judges, juries, and
prosecutors are supposed to distinguish the two. Saying “this isn’t free
speech, it’s hate speech” doesn’t, I think, suffice.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<p><u>i. Basic Legal Framework</u></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. law does <strong>not recognize “hate speech” as a separate
category of unprotected speech</strong>. Offensive, hateful, or even
racist expression is protected unless it falls into a <strong>recognized
exception</strong> (like true threats, incitement, or harassment in a
regulated setting).</li>
<li>There is <strong>no legal definition of “hate speech”</strong> under
federal law.</li>
<li>All exceptions must be:
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrowly defined</strong></li>
<li><strong>Content-neutral</strong> (except in rare categories like
incitement)</li>
<li><strong>Historically rooted</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><u>ii. On Libel</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Libel</strong> is a form of
<strong>defamation</strong>—specifically, <strong>written or published
false statements</strong> that <strong>harm someone's
reputation</strong>.
<ul>
<li>If spoken, it’s called <strong>slander</strong>.</li>
<li>If written (newspaper, book, online post, TV caption, etc.), it’s
<strong>libel</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Libel = Defamation in a fixed medium</strong> that damages a
person’s <strong>reputation</strong>, <strong>livelihood</strong>, or
<strong>public standing</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Elements of a Libel claim:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>plaintiff (the person suing)</strong> generally must
prove:</li>
<li><strong>False Statement of Fact</strong><br />
The statement must be <strong>objectively false</strong>, not just an
opinion or insult.</li>
<li><strong>Publication</strong><br />
It must be communicated to <strong>someone other than the
plaintiff</strong> (e.g., in a newspaper, blog, social media,
etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Identification</strong><br />
The plaintiff must be <strong>specifically identifiable</strong>, either
by name or clear reference.</li>
<li><strong>Harm to Reputation</strong><br />
The statement must have caused <strong>actual reputational or economic
harm</strong> (sometimes presumed).</li>
<li><strong>Fault</strong>
<ul>
<li>If the plaintiff is a <strong>private figure</strong>, negligence
may be enough.</li>
<li>If the plaintiff is a <strong>public figure or public
official</strong>, they must prove <strong>“actual malice”</strong> —
meaning the speaker <strong>knew it was false</strong> or <strong>acted
with reckless disregard for the truth</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><u>iii. Key Textbooks</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Erwin Chemerinsky</strong>, <em>Constitutional Law:
Principles and Policies</em> — standard textbook in U.S. law
schools.</li>
<li><strong>Laurence Tribe</strong>, <em>Constitutional Law</em> —
foundational liberal constitutional theory.</li>
<li><strong>Robert Post</strong>, <strong>Toni Massaro</strong> —
leading First Amendment theorists.</li>
<li><strong>Volokh's own law review articles and blog</strong> — widely
read, often cited in legal scholarship and opinions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Bodily Autonomy
<ul>
<li>“If <em>Dobbs</em> reclaims democratic control of abortion, does
that undermine <em>Obergefell</em> and <em>Lawrence</em> by logic—even
if not by holding?”
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>“The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, and such a
right is not deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition, nor
implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Washington v. Glucksberg
(1997) Rehnquist.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>BUT GLUCKSBERG WAS UNANIMOUS</li>
<li>==O'Connor, Souter, and Stevens rejected the test.==</li>
<li>Lawrence v. Texas (2003) explicitly rejected it.</li>
<li>Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) acknowledged Glucksberg, but used
different reasoning, focused on dignity, personal identity, and evolving
norms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“Do you think Dobbs will eventually be seen as one of the worst
decisions in history, or just a doctrinal ting?”</li>
<li>==“What case or principle would you use to rebuild reproductive
autonomy jurisprudence—if any?”==</li>
<li>“Do you think <em>Casey’s</em> ‘undue burden’ test was more judicial
restraint or judicial policymaking?”</li>
<li>Intermediate</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>“I’m also trying to situate these debates in the context of systems
like China, where abortion ==is regulated but always subordinate to
state goals== like population planning…”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How can a right be “fundamental” enough to override democratic
majorities—yet not be clearly stated anywhere in the Constitution?
<ul>
<li>Abortion (<em>Roe</em>, <em>Casey</em>)</li>
<li>Marriage (<em>Loving</em>, <em>Obergefell</em>)</li>
<li>Sexual intimacy (<em>Lawrence</em>)</li>
<li>Parenting (<em>Meyer</em>, <em>Pierce</em>)</li>
<li>Contraception (<em>Griswold</em>, <em>Eisenstadt</em>)</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>You can’t <strong>logically distinguish</strong> between the
<strong>doctrinal basis for abortion</strong> and <strong>same-sex
marriage</strong>, yet one was destroyed (<em>Dobbs</em>), the other
(for now) remains.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Why is the right to marry someone of the same sex
fundamental, but the right to terminate a pregnancy is not—when both
rely on the same doctrine that the Court now says is too vague to
uphold?”</strong></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Selective judicial ideology/morality?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Era of courts (Lochner, Warren, Burger, Rehnquist, Roberts) --
Increasingly conservative? Why?</li>
<li>==With so many inequality cases, and i feel like most times
according to a modern point of view, they are arguing within a closed
system, using elegant logic to argue based on absurd premises. For
example, abortion, no privacy, Plessy.==

<li>The Supreme Court is the only American institution that writes the
meaning of the Constitution without ever admitting it rewrote
anything.</li>
<li>De facto constitutional reform body</li>

<p>Even the Warren rush was bounded: it took <strong>twenty-one

longer conservative tide.</p>
<h4 id="3-when-constitutional-change-requires-more-than-courts">3 When
Constitutional Change Requires More than Courts</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Civil War &amp; Reconstruction:</strong> Slavery’s abolition
demanded both <strong>warfare</strong> and the 13th–15th Amendments; the
ante-bellum Court could not resolve the contradiction it helped
instigate (<em>Dred Scott</em> 1857).</li>
<li><strong>Prohibition &amp; Repeal:</strong> The 18th Amendment proved
that nationwide moral legislation required super-majoritarian buy-in—and
failed when public support collapsed (21st Amendment).</li>
<li><strong>Civil-Rights Movement:</strong> Massive social mobilization
plus the 1964 Civil Rights Act finally gave <em>Brown</em> teeth.<br />
These episodes display a pattern: <strong>durable constitutional
revolutions emerge only when legal doctrine, congressional action, and
public consent converge.</strong> Courts alone cannot sustain change if
“most people are not prepared to obey the rule most of the time.”</li>

<strong>until the normal political process is blocked</strong>—e.g.,
when disenfranchised groups cannot legislate their own relief. Classic
triggers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Voting barriers</strong> (<em>Shelby County</em> 2013
curtailed, but <em>Allen v. Milligan</em> 2023 shows the doctrine
lives).</li>
<li><strong>Entrenched mal-apportionment</strong>—ignored until 1962–65,
when the Court issued ~50 reapportionment decisions: <em>Baker v.
Carr</em> (1962) opens the door; <em>Reynolds v. Sims</em> (1964)
imposes “one person, one vote”; <em>Gray v. Sanders</em> (1963) rejects
“land over people.” Illinois, with huge Chicago under-representation,
was a poster-child.</li>

<h4
id="5-self-correction-the-courts-reluctance-to-overrule-itself">5 Self-Correction:
The Court’s Reluctance to Overrule Itself</h4>

<li>Fewer than a dozen precedents are expressly overruled per decade.
<em>West Coast Hotel</em> (1937) killed <em>Lochner</em>; <em>Brown</em>
(1954) buried <em>Plessy</em>; <em>Lawrence</em> (2003) reversed
<em>Bowers</em>; <em>Dobbs</em> (2022) reversed <em>Roe/Casey</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>rarity</strong> feeds the myth that the Court is

a critical mass, the Justices pivot—often after decades of
criticism.</li>

imply Black inferiority if they are "equal."<br />
 – The 14th Amendment was never intended to abolish social
distinctions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
 – Does a state law mandating racial segregation on common carriers
violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause or the
Thirteenth Amendment?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
 – <strong>No.</strong> Segregation is constitutional so long as the
facilities are "equal" in quality—birth of the
<strong>“separate‑but‑equal”</strong> doctrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Justice Brown):</strong><br />
 – The 14th Amendment guarantees legal—not social—equality.<br />
 – Segregation does not, per se, stamp the Black race with a badge of
inferiority; any such feeling "is due solely to that race’s
interpretation."<br />
 – The law applies equally to both races (both are punished for entering
the "wrong" coach).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissent (Justice Harlan):</strong><br />
 – <strong>Color‑blind Constitution</strong>: The law "cannot permit any
public authority to know the race of those entitled to be
protected."<br />
 – Warned that the decision would prove as pernicious as
<em>Dred Scott</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precedents / Authorities cited?</strong><br />

 – Legitimized Jim Crow for nearly six decades.<br />
 – Overruled <em>de jure</em> in <em>Brown v. Board</em> (1954) but

United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144 (1938)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
 – Congress passed the <strong>Filled Milk Act of 1923</strong>,
criminalizing interstate shipment of "Milnut"—milk mixed with coconut
oil—on public‑health grounds.<br />
 – Carolene Products was indicted for violating the Act and argued it
lacked a rational basis, breaching the Fifth Amendment’s Due
Process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Carolene’s argument?</strong><br />
 – Scientific evidence showed filled milk is no more harmful than dairy
butterfat; the statute is economic protectionism for dairy
interests.<br />
 – Thus violates substantive due process just like the Lochner line of
cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Government’s argument?</strong><br />
 – Congress reasonably believed filled milk endangered children; the
Court must defer under its <strong>police power</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
 – Does economic legislation that restricts a specific food product
violate substantive due process when the health justification is
contested?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
 – <strong>No.</strong> The Act is constitutional. Courts will defer if
any <strong>conceivable rational basis</strong> exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Justice Stone):</strong><br />
 – Judicial review of <strong>economic regulation is narrow</strong>. It
is up to legislators, not judges, to weigh evidence.<br />
 – Court abandons Lochner‑style scrutiny for economic laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Famous Footnote Four:</strong><br />
 1. <strong>Bill of Rights</strong> violations may merit stricter
review;<br />
 2. Laws distorting <strong>political processes</strong> (voting,
dissemination of information) may require more exacting judicial
scrutiny;<br />
 3. Laws targeting <strong>"discrete and insular minorities"</strong>
need heightened vigilance.<br />
 👉 Birth of tiers‑of‑scrutiny &amp; modern Equal Protection
doctrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constitutional provision?</strong><br />
 – Fifth Amendment <strong>Due Process</strong> (applies to federal
statutes).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong> – <strong>Rational basis</strong>
for economic regulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
 – Marks the <strong>end of Lochner</strong> era.<br />

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
 – After Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt issued
<strong>EO 9066</strong> authorizing military zones.<br />
 – Civilian Exclusion Order 34 required all persons of Japanese ancestry
to evacuate the West Coast.<br />
 – <strong>Fred Korematsu</strong>, native‑born citizen, refused
relocation, was arrested, convicted, and appealed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Korematsu’s argument?</strong><br />
 – The order imposes <strong>race‑based internment</strong> without
individualized suspicion, violating equal protection (via 5th Am Due
Process) and fundamental liberties.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Government’s argument?</strong><br />
 – Military necessity: fear of espionage and sabotage justified swift
group measures; courts must defer in wartime.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
 – Can the federal government exclude and intern U.S. citizens based
solely on race under wartime powers?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
 – <strong>Yes.</strong> The exclusion order is constitutional.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Justice Black):</strong><br />
 – Racial classifications are suspect and subject to strict scrutiny,
<strong>but</strong> the gravest imminent danger can justify them.<br />
 – Court deferred to the military’s judgment of necessity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissents:</strong><br />
 – <strong>Murphy:</strong> Called it "legalized racism", no evidence of
threat.<br />
 – <strong>Jackson:</strong> Warned the decision lies about facts; once
precedent, it’s a "loaded weapon".<br />
 – <strong>Roberts:</strong> No due process, obvious race
discrimination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Later treatment:</strong><br />
 – Documents in the 1980s showed the government lied about military
necessity; Korematsu’s conviction vacated (coram nobis).<br />
 – <strong>Trump v. Hawaii</strong> (2018): Court said Korematsu was
"gravely wrong," effectively disavowing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance?</strong><br />
 – Stands as the <strong>canonical warning</strong> of deference gone
wrong.<br />
 – Illustrates the fragility of civil liberties in wartime.</p>

 – Consolidated cases from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware,
D.C.<br />
 – Black children forced to attend segregated schools with inferior
facilities and resources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plaintiffs’ argument?</strong><br />
 – Segregation denies equal educational opportunities, violates Equal
Protection even if physical facilities are equal.<br />
 – Relied on social science (Dr. Kenneth Clark’s doll tests) showing
psychological harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>States’ argument?</strong><br />
 – Relied on <em>Plessy</em>: separate but equal satisfies the
Constitution; education is a state matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
 – Does state‑mandated public‑school segregation violate the Equal
Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
 – <strong>Yes.</strong> Separate educational facilities are
<strong>inherently unequal</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Chief Justice Warren, unanimous):</strong><br />
 – Education is "the most important function" of state and local
gov’t.<br />
 – Segregation generates <strong>sense of inferiority</strong> that
affects motivation to learn.<br />
 – Historical intent of 14th Amendment inconclusive; must be read in
light of present-day importance of education.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Implementation (Brown II – 1955):</strong><br />
 – Desegregation "<strong>with all deliberate speed</strong>"—led to

<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
 – In Washington D.C., 12 Black children were denied entry to an
all‑white school (John Philip Sousa JHS).<br />
 – Because D.C. is federal territory, plaintiffs couldn’t invoke
14th Amendment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plaintiffs’ argument?</strong><br />
 – Segregation by the federal government violates the <strong>Due
Process Clause</strong> of the 5th Amendment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Government’s argument?</strong><br />
 – Congress has plenary authority over D.C.; segregation is
long‑standing policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
 – Does the Fifth Amendment prohibit the federal government from
operating segregated schools?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
 – <strong>Yes.</strong> Segregation in D.C. schools violates
<strong>due process</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Chief Justice Warren):</strong><br />
 – "Liberty" under the Fifth Amendment incorporates notions of
equality.<br />
 – Discrimination so unjustifiable as to be arbitrary violates due
process.<br />
 – Hence, equality principles <strong>reverse‑incorporated</strong> into
the Fifth Amendment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong> – Effectively <strong>strict
scrutiny</strong> for racial classifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong><br />
 – Created <strong>reverse incorporation</strong>: Equal Protection
norms apply to the federal gov’t via Fifth Amendment.<br />
 – Ensured desegregation of all public schools nationwide, not just in

<h4 id="spring-2017-issue-spotting-exam">Spring 2017 Issue-Spotting
Exam</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress has decided to raise revenue and encourage civics education
by opening a theme park that celebrates the Supreme Court's history. The
park is named "The Least Dangerous Park." Tickets to the park are $50
for anyone of non-Irish heritage and (given rising anti-U2 sentiment in
the United States) $100 for anyone with Irish heritage.</p>
<p>The park includes such attractions as the Carter Coal Mine Ride, Ride
with the Four Horsemen, and the Schechter Poultry Petting Zoo. Early on,
Congress received a number of strongly worded letters from vegans
condemning the park's Slaughterhouse Cases Ride (a flume ride which
takes riders on a gruesome but celebratory tour of New Orleans
slaughterhouses). To avoid such complaints going forward, Congress has
banned all vegans from the ride.</p>
<p>Certain park employees dress up as Supreme Court justices and walk
around having their pictures taken with guests. The park is committed to
historical verisimilitude, and thus will only hire people to portray
Supreme Court justices who have the characteristics of the individual
justices. These employees wear period-appropriate clothing and giant
foam heads molded to look like the justice in question. No part of the
employees' bodies are visible when the employee is in full costume.The
park is currently looking for someone to portray Justice Antonin
Scalia.</p>
<p>In the months since the park has opened, it has garnered terrible
Yelp reviews. In addition, several parties have sued, each claiming that
the federal government has acted unconstitutionally.</p>
<p>Ed Mulgrave, a Chicago Resident of Irish descent who wants to play a
lower fee. Winston Zeddmore, a vegan from NOLA who would really like to
ride the Slaughterhouse cases ride.</p>
<p>Walter Peck, a Black man rejected from the position of Antonin
Scalia.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Does Mulgrave have standing to sue?
<ul>
<li>Mootness ok, ripeness and standing doubtful, unless he actually
entered the park</li>
<li>If Ed did <strong>not attempt to buy a ticket</strong> and was
deterred by the pricing structure, he <strong>may still have
standing</strong> under ==<em>"chilling effect"</em> doctrine== (cf.
<em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U.S. 555 (1992); <em>Susan
B. Anthony List v. Driehaus</em>, 573 U.S. 149 (2014)).</li>
<li>Mulgrave likely has standing if he credibly alleges he was deterred
from entering the park by the discriminatory pricing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The operation, maintenance of the park are definitely state
action</li>
<li>Equal protection clause (different fee)
<ul>
<li>Segregate but equal, unconstitutional according to Plessy and
Korematsu</li>
<li>Discrimination based on national origin</li>
<li>Strict scrutiny</li>
<li>Loving v. Virginia</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Equal protection clause (vegan ban)
<ul>
<li>Standing true: injury-in-fact, causation, redressability</li>
<li>But it's based on personal preferences, not protected classes under
EP framework, and not even a suspect class (sex and gender) under
intermediate scrunity</li>
<li>To become strict scrutiny, it has to be a hybrid rights claim
<ul>
<li>e.g., combining vegan preference based on religion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rational basis</li>
<li>If it's a private meat food restaurant bans all vegans from
entering, it is usually valid?</li>
<li>If its Congressional dining hall? Likely not.</li>
<li>Deference to Congress about economic regulations</li>
<li>Precedent: Carolene Products, brown, plessy, korematsu?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Civil rights violation (employment discrimination? equal protection
violation? or it is justified by the purpose)
<ul>
<li>Standing yes, again, three principles.</li>
<li>What is the reason for rejection? Race? or other merits?</li>
<li>Fundamental right: discrimination based on race or it's a neccessary
thing</li>
<li>Government interest: historical accuracy to find someone as closely
resembling Scalia as possible</li>
<li>Any racial classification -&gt; strict scrutiny
<ul>
<li>Compelling government interest: Big NO for theatrical, artistic
reasons</li>
<li>Narrowly tailored: NO, Even if “visual resemblance” is the goal,
using race as a proxy is overinclusive and underinclbv No skin is
visible, any visual difference could be adjusted via costuming or mask
design</li>
<li>Racial characteristics cannot be BFOQs (bona fide occupational
qualifications)</li>
<li>Brown, Loving</li>
<li>But, everyone is covered without being able to see the full body.
<ul>
<li>So, unless there are other characteristics that the government wants
to imitate, like height, weight, accent, etc, they cannot reject the
employment based solely on race.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To overrule, the Court must go beyond just condemning the prior
ruling, but explicitly "reject or overrule" it in a very similar new
case?</li>

Annotated Section 1: Citizenship and civil rights</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and
subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States
and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>The two pages of the Congressionally-signed original of the
Fourteenth Amendment in the National Archives, written with iron gall
ink on parchment. It was last publicly displayed in 2013. As of 2025, it
is stored in the research wing of the archives inside a boxed book of
Acts of Congress from its 39th session.</p>
<p>Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment formally defines United States
citizenship and protects various civil rights from being abridged or
denied by any state law or state action. In Shelley v. Kraemer (1948),
the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's historical
context of countering the discriminatory Black Codes of Southern states
must be used in its interpretation.Primarily written by Representative
John Bingham, Section 1 is the most frequently litigated part of the
amendment, and this amendment is the most frequently litigated part of
the Constitution.</p>
<h3 id="citizenship-clause">Citizenship Clause</h3>
<p>Senator Jacob M. Howard of Michigan, author of the Citizenship Clause
The Citizenship Clause overruled the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision
that African Americans could not become citizens. The clause
constitualized the Civil Rights Act of 1866's grant of citizenship to
all born within the United States, except the children of foreign
diplomats. Compared against European jus sanguinis laws that assign
citizenship by one's parents, historians have framed the United States'
Citizenship Clause as an extension of the Fourteenth Amendment's
egalitarian principles.</p>
<p>Congress' debate over the Citizenship Clause shows explicit rejection
of Senator Edgar Cowan's anti-Romani sentiment, affirming that
birthright citizenship cannot be revoked from children born to
disfavored ethnic minorities. In United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898),
the Supreme Court confirmed that children born in the United States
receive birthright citizenship, regardless of whether their parents are
non-citizen immigrants.</p>
<p>In Elk v. Wilkins (1884), the Supreme Court interpreted the
Citizenship Clause as granting birthright citizenship to all born within
the jurisdiction of the United States and allowing Congress to establish
alternative pathways for naturalization. Consistent with the views of
the clause's author, Senator Jacob M. Howard, the Supreme Court held
that because Indian reservations are not under the federal government's
jurisdiction, Native Americans born on such land are not entitled to
birthright citizenship. The 1887 Dawes Act offered citizenship to Native
Americans who accepted private property as part of cultural
assimilation, while the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act offered citizenship
to all Native Americans born within the nation's territorial limits.</p>
<p>In Mackenzie v. Hare (1915), the Supreme Court upheld the
Expatriation Act of 1907, which dictated that all American women who
voluntarily married a foreign alien renounced their American
citizenship. Perez v. Brownell (1958) similarly held that Congress could
designate voting in foreign elections or draft evasion as renunciations
of citizenship. However, in Afroyim v. Rusk (1967) and Vance v. Terrazas
(1980), the Supreme Court reversed itself, holding that renunciations of
American citizenship must be formally expressed.</p>
<p>In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14160
to deny birthright citizenship to children with parents of illegal or
temporary immigration status. While this topic was not considered by the
39th Congress, nor has it been addressed by the Supreme Court,
enforcement of the Executive Order has been blocked as unconstitutional
by multiple federal judges. Furthermore, many of the freed slaves whose
children were covered by the Citizenship Clause were illegal immigrants
brought in violation of the 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of
Slaves.</p>
<h3 id="privileges-or-immunities-clause">Privileges or Immunities
Clause</h3>
<p>The Privileges or Immunities Clause was written to provide
congressional power of enforcement to the similar Privileges and
Immunities Clause of Article Four of the Constitution. In 1823, Supreme
Court Justice Bushrod Washington decided Corfield v. Coryell,
interpreting the latter clause as protecting the right to travel, seek
habeas corpus, and hold property in multiple states, among other rights.
In the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), the Supreme Court rejected
arguments that the Privileges or Immunities Clause further incorporated
the Bill of Rights against state governments or transferred police power
to the federal government. In McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) and
Timbs v. Indiana (2019), Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas advocated
transferring the incorporation doctrine from the Due Process Clause to
the Privileges or Immunities Clause, but this has been criticized as a
veiled attempt to restrict the rights of non-citizens within the United
States.</p>
<h3 id="due-process-clause">Due Process Clause</h3>
<p>Due process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot
be determined by reference to any code. The best that can be said is
that, through the course of this Court's decisions, it has represented
the balance which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for the
liberty of the individual, has struck between that liberty and the
demands of organized society. If the supplying of content to this
constitutional concept has of necessity been a rational process, it
certainly has not been one where judges have felt free to roam where
unguided speculation might take them. The balance of which I speak is
the balance struck by this country, having regard to what history
teaches are the traditions from which it developed as well as the
traditions from which it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A
decision of this Court which radically departs from it could not long
survive, while a decision which builds on what has survived is likely to
be sound. No formula could serve as a substitute, in this area, for
judgment and restraint.</p>
<p>The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly applies
the Fifth Amendment's similar clause to state governments. In protecting
all people against arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property,
courts have recognized both procedural and substantive due process.
Procedural due process deals with the processes for restraining life,
liberty, or property, such as the right to be notified of a hearing by a
neutral decision-maker. In comparison, substantive due process involves
the government's justification for engaging in those processes. In
deciding whether legislation unconstitutionally infringes on one's
liberty, most government acts are subject to rational basis review,
under which the government must present a legitimate state interest.
When the government infringes on fundamental rights, such as racial
equality, strict scrutiny requires its actions to instead be narrowly
tailored to address a compelling state interest.</p>
<p>The early 20th century has been referred to as the Lochner era for
the Supreme Court's embrace of a freedom of contract in cases like
Allgeyer v. Louisiana (1897) and Lochner v. New York (1905). While that
freedom was ultimately curtailed in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish
(1937), those early cases recognized substantive due process rights
within the Due Process Clause. For example, Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) and
Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) struck down anti-immigrant state
education laws as violations of substantive due process.</p>
<p>In 1890, future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis and his law
partner, Samuel D. Warren II, published "The Right to Privacy" in the
Harvard Law Review. While the article only advocated for tort actions to
protect one's privacy, the Supreme Court later elevated privacy to a
fundamental right, protecting contraceptive sales in Griswold v.
Connecticut (1965), consensual sex in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), and
same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges under substantive due process.
In Roe v. Wade (1973), the Supreme Court recognized a substantive due
process right to abortion, but that holding was overturned in Dobbs v.
Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), which claimed that "a right
to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and
traditions."</p>
<h4 id="incorporation-of-the-bill-of-rights">Incorporation of the Bill
of Rights</h4>
<p>Prior to the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court held in Barron
v. Baltimore (1833) that the Bill of Rights only restrained the federal
government. However, in Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v.
City of Chicago (1897), the Supreme Court applied the Fifth Amendment's
Takings Clause to the eminent domain power of state governments under
the Due Process Clause, beginning an ongoing process of incorporation.
Legal scholar Akhil Reed Amar has argued that while Congress intended
the Fourteenth Amendment to reverse the Barron decision, Representative
Bingham expected incorporation to rely on the Privileges or Immunities
Clause. The Supreme Court has explicitly rejected incorporation of the
Fifth Amendment's Grand Jury Clause and Seventh Amendment, and it has
never addressed the Third Amendment.</p>
<h3 id="equal-protection-clause">Equal Protection Clause</h3>
<p>Rep. John Bingham of Ohio was the principal author of the Equal
Protection Clause. The Equal Protection Clause was written to
constitutionalize the anti-discrimination principles of the Civil Rights
Act of 1866, preventing enforcement of the southern states' Black
Codes.　In Strauder v. West Virginia (1880), the Supreme Court
recognized exclusion of African Americans from West Virginian juries as
an unconstitutional infringement of this clause, triggering the 1866
law's provision to remove the underlying case to federal court. In Yick
Wo v. Hopkins (1886), the Supreme Court clarified that race-neutral laws
administered in discriminatory ways were similarly unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Whereas the Privileges or Immunities Clause refers to citizens, this
clause refers to all people within the jurisdiction of the United
States. Accordingly, in Plyler v. Doe (1982), the Supreme Court
prohibited state governments from restricting public education on the
basis of a child's immigration status. In that decision, Justice William
J. Brennan Jr. noted that in Wong Wing v. United States (1896), the
Supreme Court had already recognized illegal immigrants as within
American jurisdiction for the purposes of due process rights.</p>
<p>While the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause incorporates the
Bill of Rights against state governments, the Fifth Amendment's similar
clause has been used for reverse incorporation of the Equal Protection
Clause against the federal government. In Bolling v. Sharpe (1954), the
Supreme Court used this doctrine to prevent the federal government from
maintaining segregated public schools in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court also decided whether foreign corporations are also
within the jurisdiction of a state, ruling that a foreign corporation
which sued in a state court in which it was not licensed to do business
to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another
state was within the jurisdiction and could not be subjected to unequal
burdens in the maintenance of the suit. When a state has admitted a
foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation
is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not necessarily to
identical treatment with domestic corporations.</p>
<p>In Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad (1886), the court
reporter included a statement by Chief Justice Morrison Waite in the
decision's headnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the
provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids
a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the
opinion that it does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This dictum, which established that corporations enjoyed personhood
under the Equal Protection Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later
courts.[51] It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth
century, though it was challenged in dissents by justices such as Hugo
Black and William O. Douglas.[52] Between 1890 and 1910, Fourteenth
Amendment cases involving corporations vastly outnumbered those
involving the rights of blacks, 288 to 19.[53]</p>
<p>In Plessy v. Ferguson (1896),[54] the Supreme Court held that the
states could impose racial segregation so long as they provided similar
facilities—the formation of the "separate but equal" doctrine.[55] The
Court went even further in restricting the Equal Protection Clause in
Berea College v. Kentucky (1908),[56] holding that the states could
force private actors to discriminate by prohibiting colleges from having
both black and white students. By the early 20th century, the Equal
Protection Clause had been eclipsed to the point that Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes Jr. dismissed it as "the usual last resort of
constitutional arguments."[57]</p>
<p>The Court held to the "separate but equal" doctrine for more than
fifty years, despite numerous cases in which the Court itself had found
that the segregated facilities provided by the states were almost never
equal, until Brown v. Board of Education (1954) reached the Court.[58]
In Brown the Court ruled that even if segregated black and white schools
were of equal quality in facilities and teachers, segregation was
inherently harmful to black students and so was unconstitutional. Brown
met with a campaign of resistance from white Southerners, and for
decades the federal courts attempted to enforce Brown's mandate against
repeated attempts at circumvention.[59] This resulted in the
controversial desegregation busing decrees handed down by federal courts
in various parts of the nation.[60] In Parents Involved in Community
Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court ruled that
race could not be the determinative factor in determining to which
public schools parents may transfer their children.[61][62]</p>
<p>In Hernandez v. Texas (1954), the Court held that the Fourteenth
Amendment protects those beyond the racial classes of white or "Negro"
and extends to other racial and ethnic groups, such as Mexican Americans
in this case.[63] In the half-century following Brown, the Court
extended the reach of the Equal Protection Clause to other historically
disadvantaged groups, such as women and illegitimate children, although
it has applied a somewhat less stringent standard than it has applied to
governmental discrimination on the basis of race (United States v.
Virginia (1996);[64] Levy v. Louisiana (1968)[65]).[66]</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled in Regents of the University of California v.
Bakke (1978)[67] that affirmative action in the form of racial quotas in
public university admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several
factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title
VI.[68] In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003)[69] and Grutter v. Bollinger
(2003),[70] the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems
at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in
its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity.[71] In Gratz,
the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system
that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity
violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a
race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that
used race as one of many factors to determine admission.[72] In Fisher
v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race can be
used in a public university's admission policy, there must be no
workable race-neutral alternative.[73][74] In Schuette v. Coalition to
Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality
of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of
affirmative action.[75][76]</p>
<p>Reed v. Reed (1971),[77] which struck down an Idaho probate law
favoring men, was the first decision in which the Court ruled that
arbitrary gender discrimination violated the Equal Protection
Clause.[78] In Craig v. Boren (1976),[79] the Court ruled that statutory
or administrative sex classifications had to be subjected to an
intermediate standard of judicial review.[80] Reed and Craig later
served as precedents to strike down a number of state laws
discriminating by gender.[78]</p>
<p>Since Wesberry v. Sanders (1964)[81] and Reynolds v. Sims (1964),[82]
the Supreme Court has interpreted the Equal Protection Clause as
requiring the states to apportion their congressional districts and
state legislative seats according to "one man, one vote".[83] The Court
has also struck down redistricting plans in which race was a key
consideration. In Shaw v. Reno (1993),[84] the Court prohibited a North
Carolina plan aimed at creating majority-black districts to balance
historic under-representation in the state's congressional
delegations.[85]</p>
<p>In Pitts v. Black (1984) the Court established that, by refusing the
homeless to register to vote, the New York City Board of Elections was
in breach of the Equal Protection Clause. As a result, homeless voters
were allowed to cast their ballots.[86]</p>
<p>The Equal Protection Clause served as the basis for the decision in
Bush v. Gore (2000),[87] in which the Court ruled that no
constitutionally valid recount of Florida's votes in the 2000
presidential election could be held within the needed deadline; the
decision effectively secured Bush's victory in the disputed
election.[88] In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry
(2006),[89] the Court ruled that House majority leader Tom DeLay's Texas
redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of Latinos and thus
violated the Equal Protection Clause.[90]</p>
<h3 id="state-actor-doctrine">State actor doctrine</h3>
<p>The Eleventh Amendment provides state governments with sovereign
immunity from federal lawsuits brought by citizens of other states, and
in Hans v. Louisiana (1890), the Supreme Court held that it implies
immunity from all lawsuits brought by private parties. In Fitzpatrick v.
Bitzer (1976), the Supreme Court determined that Section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment's congressional power of enforcement allows the
federal government to limit state sovereign immunity.[91]</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Ex parte Young (1908), the Supreme Court held that
private individuals could seek federal injunctions against state
officials to prevent enforcement of unconstitutional laws, reasoning
that unconstitutional conduct can never be a protected state action.
Similarly, in Shelley v. Kraemer (1948), the Supreme Court held that
while the federal government cannot prevent private parties from
establishing racially discriminatory housing covenants, state and
federal courts cannot enforce them.[92]</p>
<p>In cases like Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co. (1974) and Flagg
Bros., Inc. v. Brooks (1978), the Supreme Court clarified that state
laws do not transform regulated businesses into state actors. Thus,
private companies are free to engage in conduct that would be
unconstitutional for state governments to pursue, though the federal
government can prevent discriminatory private conduct under its Commerce
Clause authority, and state governments may further regulate business
operations.[93]</p>

<p>Of course — and you're very smart to allow extra room for

<h3 id="3-united-states-v-virginia-518-us-515-1996">3. United States v.
Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Virginia Military Institute (VMI), a prestigious and publicly funded
military college, had a <strong>male-only admission policy</strong>. It
was the only single-sex public higher education institution in Virginia
and had a reputation for a rigorous, adversative (harsh, militaristic)
training method to develop "citizen-soldiers."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plaintiffs’ argument?</strong><br />
– The United States sued Virginia, claiming that <strong>excluding
women</strong> from VMI violated the <strong>Equal Protection
Clause</strong> of the Fourteenth Amendment.<br />
– Separate but equal is not permissible here; the state's action must
meet <strong>heightened scrutiny</strong> for sex-based
classifications.<br />
– VMI’s male-only policy perpetuated archaic stereotypes about gender
roles and deprived women of unique educational opportunities. –
Virginia’s proposal to create a separate program for women (Virginia
Women's Institute for Leadership at Mary Baldwin College) was
<strong>not an adequate remedy</strong> because it was not equivalent in
prestige, rigor, or opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Virginia’s defense?</strong><br />
– Claimed that admitting women would <strong>fundamentally
alter</strong> VMI’s unique adversative method.<br />
– Argued that creating a parallel women's program at another school
(VWIL) was sufficient to meet constitutional requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
– Does Virginia's exclusion of women from VMI violate the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes.</strong> VMI’s male-only admissions policy was
unconstitutional, and the proposed alternative program for women did
<strong>not cure the violation</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Justice Ginsburg, majority):</strong><br />
– The state must show an "<strong>exceedingly persuasive
justification</strong>" for gender-based classifications.<br />
– Generalizations about women's abilities or preferences cannot justify
state-sponsored exclusion. – VWIL was <strong>not genuinely
equal</strong> to VMI: it offered less rigorous training, lower funding,
different academic offerings, and inferior prestige.<br />
– VMI's goals (producing citizen-soldiers through adversative methods)
could be achieved without <strong>excluding women entirely</strong>; the
program could adapt.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong><br />
– <strong>Intermediate scrutiny</strong>, but
<strong>intensified</strong>:<br />
– The classification must serve important governmental objectives.<br />
– The means employed must be substantially related to achieving those
objectives.<br />
– The justification must be "<strong>exceedingly persuasive</strong>" —
a stricter version of intermediate scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong><br />
– Cemented <strong>gender-based discrimination</strong> as requiring
<strong>heightened (almost strict) intermediate scrutiny</strong>.<br />
– Rejected overbroad generalizations about gender roles.<br />

<strong>separate but unequal</strong> facilities violate equal

<p><strong>Facts?</strong><br />
– Texas financed public schools through a statewide foundation program

Edgewood I.S.D. raised far less per pupil than affluent Alamo Heights,
even though Edgewood taxed itself at a ==<em>higher</em>== rate.</p>

– The scheme discriminates against a <strong>suspect class of poor

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State’s argument?</strong><br />
– Local control justifies relying on local property wealth; education is
not a fundamental right and wealth is not a suspect class.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
– Does the Texas finance system violate the Equal Protection Clause
because it creates wealth-based disparities in per-pupil spending?</p>

– <strong>No.</strong> Wealth is not a suspect classification and
education, though important, is not a fundamental right; rational-basis

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Justice Powell):</strong><br />
<strong>First</strong>, the plaintiffs could not define a discrete
<em>indigent</em> class—poor families are scattered across
districts.<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, no child suffers an <strong>absolute
deprivation</strong> of schooling; disparities are relative.<br />
<strong>Third</strong>, strict scrutiny is reserved for suspect classes
(race, alienage, etc.) or fundamental rights; neither is present.<br />
<strong>Fourth</strong>, the system rationally furthers two legitimate
goals: (1) <strong>local fiscal autonomy</strong> and (2)
experimentation in educational policy.</p>

irrational because equal tax effort yields radically unequal revenue. ​

“vital to political and social life” and should trigger heightened
scrutiny; the State must show its means are substantially related to
achieving legitimate goals, which it failed to do. ​</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>No.</strong> Section 21.031 violates the Equal Protection
Clause.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Justice Brennan):</strong><br />
<strong>First</strong>, undocumented children are “<em>persons</em>”
within the Fourteenth Amendment.<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, the classification is neither suspect nor
wholly ordinary; education is not fundamental, <strong>but</strong> the
deprivation is grave and permanent.<br />
<strong>Third</strong>, Texas’s asserted interests (saving money,
discouraging migration, classroom burdens) are speculative and poorly
tailored.<br />
<strong>Fourth</strong>, the statute would create an illiterate
underclass, harming the State and Nation—so even under

– Cleburne required a special-use permit for a 13-person <strong>group
home for the mentally retarded</strong>, yet allowed boarding houses,
hospitals, dorms, etc., as of right in the same zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plaintiffs’ argument?</strong><br />
– The permit denial rested on irrational stereotypes and violated equal
protection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>City’s argument?</strong><br />
– Mentally retarded residents pose unique concerns (flood plain,
junior-high harassment, density, legal liability).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
– Does denying the permit violate equal protection, and is
<strong>mental retardation</strong> a quasi-suspect classification?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes (as-applied)</strong>; the ordinance is irrational here,
but mental retardation is <strong>not</strong> a quasi-suspect class.
<strong>UNANIMOUS JUDGMENT.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Justice White):</strong> <strong>First</strong>,
heightened scrutiny is limited to groups with deep prejudice
<em>and</em> limited political power; recent legislation shows active
political protection for the retarded.<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, nonetheless the city offered <strong>no
rational link</strong>: fears and neighbor hostility are illegitimate,
flood risk applies equally to permitted uses, and size/density limits
are inconsistently enforced.<br />
<strong>Third</strong>, mere “bare desire to harm a politically
unpopular group” is never legitimate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concurrences</strong>: <strong>Justice Stevens (joined by
Burger &amp; Powell)</strong> – Would invalidate the permit requirement
on traditional rational-basis grounds but stresses that insisting on a
special permit “reflects only unthinking prejudice.” <strong>Justice
Marshall (joined by Brennan &amp; Blackmun) (concurring in part,
dissenting in part)</strong> – Agrees the ordinance is invalid but
argues that <em>mental retardation deserves heightened scrutiny</em>
because of a long history of exclusion and the fundamental interest in
establishing a home. ​</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong> – Formal
<strong>rational-basis</strong>, but with searching inquiry
(“rational-basis <em>with bite</em>”). word games</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong><br />
– Clarified that disability is <strong>not</strong> quasi-suspect, but

– Colorado’s <strong>Amendment 2</strong> barred state or local
governments from enacting any law protecting persons from discrimination

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plaintiffs’ argument?</strong><br />
– The amendment singles out gays and lesbians for a blanket disability
and cannot survive even rational review.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

– Amendment 2 prevents special preferences and upholds freedom of
association.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issue?</strong><br />
– Does Amendment 2 violate the Equal Protection Clause?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holding?</strong><br />
– <strong>Yes.</strong> It fails even ordinary rational-basis
review.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Justice Kennedy):</strong><br />
<strong>First</strong>, equal protection requires a
<strong>connection</strong> between a classification and a legitimate
goal; here none exists.<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, the amendment is <em>both too narrow and too
broad</em>—it targets a single trait yet bans protection in every
sphere.<br />
<strong>Third</strong>, its breadth reveals a “<strong>bare…desire to
harm</strong>” an unpopular group, which is <strong>not</strong> a
legitimate state interest (citing <em>Moreno</em>).<br />
<strong>Fourth</strong>, by closing the political process to one class
alone, Amendment 2 violates the core meaning of equal protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of scrutiny?</strong> – Nominal
<strong>rational-basis</strong>, but explicitly animated by the
<em>animus doctrine</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissent (Justice Scalia, joined by Rehnquist &amp;
Thomas)</strong>: – Faults the majority for inventing a new “animus”
test; contends Amendment 2 is a permissible moral choice comparable to
Bowers v. Hardwick, and that rational-basis review should uphold a law
reflecting voters’ moral disapproval of homosexuality. (Reasoning drawn
from the opinion; no file excerpt available.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

– First Supreme Court victory for LGBT rights; established that laws
motivated by animus flunk equal protection without requiring heightened

Classifications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strict scrutiny (⁠“suspect class”⁠)</strong><br />
The State must show the law is <em>narrowly tailored</em> to meet a
<em>compelling</em> interest. The Court has only put a few
classifications here because history shows they trigger prejudice that
politics can’t easily cure.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate scrutiny (⁠“quasi-suspect class”⁠)</strong><br />
The State must show the law is <em>substantially related</em> to an
<em>important</em> interest. Sex (and illegitimacy) live here; the Court
has <em>not</em> formally moved sexual-orientation or gender-identity up
from rational-basis, though the post-<em>Obergefell</em> jurisprudence
is functionally “rational-basis-plus.”</li>
<li><strong>Rational basis (ordinary or “with bite”)</strong><br />
Law must be <em>rationally related</em> to a <em>legitimate</em>
interest. Age (<em>Murgia</em>), disability (<em>Cleburne</em>), wealth
(<em>Rodriguez</em>), etc., stay here, but the Court occasionally uses a
skeptical variant (“with bite”) when it smells animus.</li>

<p>Drawing on a recent study demonstrating that unmarried men are

formal policy of denying drivers' licenses to single men. Only married
men, and all women, may obtain a license. The policy is challenged by
Jack McCoy, an unmarried man who drives a taxi.</p>
<p>Issue: whether barring a subset of one gender is sufficient Reason:
Important government interest -- ok to reduce rate, all other remedies,
equal arguments can be made that all young drivers since they overlap,
and even worse it can be similar to the that 90% of all are DUI, and
then ban all alcohol, doesn't change the man or improve the education,
the other consequences of infriging people's right to drive and make a

<p>The adequate and independent state ground doctrine states that when a
litigant petitions the U.S. Supreme Court to review the judgment of a
state court which rests upon both federal and non-federal (state) law,
the U.S. Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction over the case if the
state ground is (1) “adequate” to support the judgment, and (2)
“independent” of federal law. <em>See <a

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts / Procedural Posture</strong><br />
– <strong>UC-Davis Med School</strong> set aside <strong>16 of 100
seats</strong> for applicants who identified as “Blacks, Chicanos,
Asians, or American Indians” and who competed only against each other
under a separate admissions track (“Special Admissions”).<br />
– <strong>Allan Bakke</strong>, a 33-year-old white male engineer and
former Marine with GPA = 3.46 &amp; MCAT = 511/600, was rejected twice,
while minority applicants with substantially lower scores were admitted
under the set-aside. – Bakke sued in <strong>California superior
court</strong> → won summary judgment → <strong>CA Supreme
Court</strong> struck the quota and ordered his admission. UC Regents
sought cert.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plaintiff’s theory (Bakke)</strong><br />
– The quota is a <strong>racial classification</strong> triggering
strict scrutiny under <strong>Equal Protection (14A)</strong>
<em>and</em> <strong>Title VI</strong> (because UC-Davis receives
federal funds).<br />
– Remedies for societal discrimination are too amorphous; there is
<strong>no showing</strong> that UC discriminated or that Bakke
personally benefitted from past discrimination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>University’s theory</strong><br />
– <strong>Compelling interests</strong>: (1) Remedying historic
exclusion of minorities from medicine; (2) Improving medical care to
underserved communities; (3) Training students for a diverse society;
(4) Obtaining educational benefits of <strong>classroom
diversity</strong> (Harvard-style rationale).<br />
– Quota is <strong>narrowly tailored</strong>: 16 seats (16%) ≈ minority
hospital-service population; race is <strong>one factor</strong> for the
remaining 84 seats.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does the special-admissions quota violate the <strong>Equal
Protection Clause</strong>?</li>

<p><strong>Holdings / Vote Map</strong><br />
– <strong>No single majority opinion</strong>; <strong>Powell’s

<ul>
<li><strong>Powell (1) + “liberal four” (Brennan, White, Marshall,
Blackmun)</strong> = 5 votes <strong>to allow race as a <em>plus
factor</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Powell + “conservative four” (Burger, Rehnquist, Stewart,
Stevens)</strong> = 5 votes <strong>to forbid a rigid quota &amp; order

</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reasoning (Justice Powell, controlling)</strong><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Standard of Review:</strong><br />
– Racial classifications by <em>any</em> government actor are
“<strong>inherently suspect</strong>” → <strong>strict scrutiny</strong>
(same for benign vs. invidious).<br />
<strong>Step 2 – Compelling Interest Analysis:</strong><br />
– <strong>Remedying societal discrimination</strong> = <em>too
ill-defined</em>.<br />
– <strong>Medical-service goals</strong> &amp; <strong>countering
shortage of minority doctors</strong> = not shown.<br />
– <strong>Classroom diversity</strong> (Harvard plan) <strong>is
compelling</strong> because it advances robust academic freedom.<br />
<strong>Step 3 – Narrow Tailoring:</strong><br />
– A <strong>fixed 16-seat quota</strong> is <em>not narrowly
tailored</em>: treats race as decisive, forecloses individual review,
lacks flexibility, no logical sunset.<br />
– A <strong>holistic system</strong> that considers race as “one factor
among many”—e.g., Harvard’s assigning an edge to “race/ethnicity” but
pitting <em>all</em> applicants in a single pool—<em>would</em>
survive.<br />
<strong>Step 4 – Statutory Mirror:</strong><br />
– <strong>Title VI</strong> is ==coextensive with Equal Protection==
whenever the defendant is a state actor; same analysis, same result.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concurrence–Dissent (Brennan, White, Marshall,
Blackmun)</strong><br />
– <strong>Standard of Review:</strong> Only <strong>intermediate
scrutiny</strong> for ==benign== racial classifications.<br />
– <strong>Remedial &amp; diversity interests</strong> are compelling;
the 16-seat set-aside is narrowly tailored.<br />
– Would <strong>uphold the plan</strong> in its entirety!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concurrence (Stevens, joined by Burger, Rehnquist,
Stewart)</strong><br />
– Focuses on <strong>Title VI</strong> text: race-based exclusion from a
federally funded program is flatly prohibited; therefore, quota illegal
<strong>without</strong> Equal-Protection analysis.<br />
– Would avoid constitutional question.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of Scrutiny Applied in Result:</strong> <strong>Strict
scrutiny</strong> (“suspect classification”); quota fails tailoring
prong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance / Aftermath</strong><br />
– First SCOTUS recognition that <strong>diversity</strong> can be a
compelling state interest.<br />
– Provided the <strong>Harvard holistic model</strong> as a
roadmap.<br />
– Spawned a trilogy: <em>Grutter v. Bollinger</em> (2003) (upheld
Michigan Law’s holistic use); <em>Gratz</em> (2003) (struck undergrad
point system); <strong>ultimately overruled in part by <em>SFFA v.
Harvard</em> (2023)</strong>, below.<br />
– Introduced the “<strong>Bakke‐two-step</strong>”: (1) diversity
compelling, (2) quotas verboten.</p>

– <em>Q:</em> “Is Title VI broader than Equal Protection?” → <strong>Not
for state actors; but Title VI can reach private universities (e.g.,
Harvard) receiving federal funding; EP does not.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “What tailoring tools did Powell suggest?” →
<strong>Individualized review, no fixed seat reservations, race as a

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts / Procedural Posture</strong><br />
– <strong>Harvard (private, Title VI)</strong> and <strong>UNC (public,

– <strong>SFFA</strong>, founded by activist Edward Blum, alleged

together.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Petitioner’s theory (SFFA)</strong><br />
– <strong>Strict scrutiny</strong>: Diversity is <strong>no longer
compelling</strong> (or never was), and even if it is, the plans are
<strong>not narrowly tailored</strong> → rely on racial stereotypes,
lack end-point, and disadvantage Asians.<br />
– <strong>Title VI</strong> incorporates Equal Protection standards;

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Majority Reasoning (Chief Justice Roberts)</strong><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Strict Scrutiny Reaffirmed:</strong><br />
– Racial classifications are <strong>“odious”</strong> and permissible
only where <em>precisely</em> tailored to a <strong>truly
compelling</strong> interest.<br />
<strong>Step 2 – Compelling Interest?</strong><br />
– Universities’ asserted benefits (“training leaders,” “combatting
stereotypes,” “civic engagement”) are <strong>immeasurable,
unreviewable, and lack a logical endpoint</strong>.<br />
– Contrasts with <em>Brown</em>’s command that racial distinctions must
be eliminated <strong>“root and branch.”</strong><br />
<strong>Step 3 – Narrow Tailoring?</strong><br />
– Data show <strong>consistent racial balancing</strong> (“strikingly
stable” admit percentages).<br />
– <strong>Race-neutral tools</strong> (geographic, socioeconomic,
first-gen preferences) were not seriously pursued.<br />
– Use of broad racial categories (<strong>Asian, Hispanic,
Black</strong>) <strong>masks intragroup diversity</strong> and peddles
stereotypes. <strong>Step 4 – Carve-outs &amp; Caveats:</strong><br />
– <strong>Military academies</strong> get “no view”—national-security
briefs left open.<br />
– Applicants may still <strong>describe how race affected them
personally</strong> (e.g., overcoming discrimination); but schools
cannot <strong>award a benefit “because of race itself.”</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sotomayor Dissent</strong><br />
– Calls majority “color-blind in theory, color-deaf in reality”; race
still matters; diversity undeniably compelling; Court “cements a
superficial rule of color-blindness.” Brown is not about eliminating
classification, but for equality. However, in reality, it's impossible
to achieve equality without classification given the entrenched
socio-economic, political disparities on the basis of race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jackson Dissent (UNC)</strong><br />
– Emphasizes <strong>intergenerational racial inequality

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of Scrutiny Applied:</strong> <strong>Strict

<strong>Majority: diversity goals “too amorphous.”+ Even if compelling,
tailoring fails. Effectively impossible to resurrect.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “What about Title VI vs. EP after SFFA?” →
<strong>Gorsuch: Title VI textually bars any racial preferences in
federally funded programs—so private universities are doubly locked
out.</strong><br />

unique national-security interests but takes no position; signals
separate litigation ahead.</strong><br />

v</em>. <em>Goguen</em>, 415 U.S. 566 (1974)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts / Procedural Posture</strong><br />
– <strong>Massachusetts G. L. c. 264 § 5</strong> made it a crime
publicly to “treat contemptuously” the U.S. flag.<br />
– <strong>Joseph Goguen</strong>, 18‑year‑old anti‑war protester, was
arrested in Worcester for wearing a small cloth flag sewn to the seat of
his jeans. A state jury (after instructions that “contemptuous” meant
whatever <em>they</em> thought showed disrespect) convicted him;
sentence of one year (suspended).<br />
– Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed. Goguen then won federal
habeas relief in District Court; First Circuit reversed, reinstating the
conviction. <strong>SCOTUS granted certiorari.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Petitioner’s Theory (Commonwealth of
Massachusetts)</strong><br />
– Flag protection statute is <strong>narrow, intelligible, and
long‑standing</strong>; ordinary citizens understand what “contemptuous”
flag treatment means.<br />
– Law regulates <strong>conduct, not expression</strong>; any expressive
elements are incidental and outweighed by state interest in preserving a
national symbol.<br />
– Even if First‑Amendment interests are implicated, the statute is
comparable to regulations on draft‑card destruction (<em>O’Brien</em>)
and survives <strong>intermediate scrutiny</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Respondent’s Theory (Goguen)</strong><br />
– Statute is <strong>unconstitutionally vague</strong> under the
<strong>Due Process Clause</strong>: gives no objective standard,
invites ad‑hoc, <strong>content‑based enforcement</strong> against
unpopular speakers.<br />
– By empowering police/juries to punish “disrespect,” the law
<strong>chills core political speech</strong> and discriminates against
dissenters.<br />
– Unlike <em>O’Brien</em>, the state’s interest is
<strong>viewpoint‑driven respect</strong>, not a neutral administrative
goal; thus fails any First‑Amendment balancing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does § 5 violate <strong>Fourteenth‑Amendment Due Process</strong>
because “treats contemptuously” is impermissibly

– <strong>Burger C.J., Rehnquist, White</strong> dissent.<br />
– (No need to reach broader First‑Amendment question once vagueness
determined.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Majority Reasoning (Justice Powell)</strong><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Vagueness Doctrine:</strong><br />
– Criminal statutes must furnish <strong>“explicit standards”</strong>
to give fair notice and prevent arbitrary enforcement
(<em>Connally</em>; <em>Papachristou</em>).<br />
<strong>Step 2 – Application to § 5:</strong><br />
– Key term “contemptuously” “<em>fails to draw reasonably clear lines
between lawful and unlawful conduct</em>.”<br />
– Statute <strong>delegates resolution of fundamental policy</strong>
(“what counts as disrespect”) to <strong>police, prosecutors, and juries
on an ad‑hoc basis</strong>, creating a risk of <strong>viewpoint
discrimination</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 3 – Distinguishing Precedent:</strong><br />
– Unlike narrowly drawn flag‑desecration bans on <strong>physical
destruction</strong> (<em>Street</em>) or <strong>government‑owned
flags</strong> (<em>Spence</em>), § 5 sweeps in any behavior a
particular jury dislikes.<br />
– Massachusetts cannot salvage the law by <strong>“judicial
narrowing”</strong>; text is inherently standard‑less.<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> Conviction set aside; statute unconstitutional
<em>as applied</em>, and effectively <strong>facially void</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concurrence (Justice Douglas)</strong><br />
– Would reach the <strong>First Amendment</strong> and hold that
punishing symbolic expression—no matter how defined—violates
<strong>core political speech principles</strong> announced in
<em>Stromberg</em> and <em>Barnette</em>.<br />
– Warns that deferential “respect‑for‑flag” statutes inevitably become
tools against unpopular dissent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissent (Justice Rehnquist, joined by Burger C.J. &amp;
White)</strong><br />
– States may legitimately protect a unifying national emblem;
“contemptuous” has a <strong>plain meaning</strong> understood by
average citizens, parallel to “obscene” in <em>Miller</em>.<br />
– Court improperly stretches vagueness to strike a law merely because it
dislikes the policy; majority should defer to state definitions and
<em>O’Brien</em> balancing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of Scrutiny Applied</strong><br />
– <strong>Vagueness / Due‑Process analysis</strong>, not classic
strict‑vs‑intermediate tiers; focus on <strong>fair‑notice &amp;
anti‑arbitrariness</strong>.<br />
– First‑Amendment merits expressly left unresolved (majority), though
concurrence would apply <strong>strict scrutiny</strong> to speech
regulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance / Immediate Fallout</strong><br />
– Reaffirmed that <strong>symbolic‑speech statutes must give clear,
objective standards</strong>, laying groundwork for later flag‑burning
victories (<em>Spence</em> ’74, <em>Johnson</em> ’89).<br />
– Illustrates Court’s <strong>two‑track flag cases</strong>: vagueness
(due process) v. viewpoint (First Amendment).<br />
– Signaled that mere legislative appeals to patriotic unity will not
excuse <strong>standard‑less criminal bans</strong>.<br />
– Invited legislatures to rewrite flag‑protection laws with
<strong>narrow, conduct‑specific language</strong>—many states attempted
“uniform code” amendments post‑1974.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socratic‑Class Landmines &amp; Answers</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “If ‘contemptuous’ is vague, why isn’t ‘obscene’ in
<em>Miller</em> equally vague?”<br />
→ <strong>Miller supplied a <strong>three‑part test</strong>; § 5 had no
comparable objective elements.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Could Massachusetts salvage the law by defining
misconduct more precisely (e.g., burning, defacing)?”<br />
→ <strong>Yes—the Court hints that a <strong>specific‑acts
statute</strong> might survive vagueness (though still faces
First‑Amendment attack).</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Does the ruling mean <em>all</em> flag‑respect laws are
void?”<br />
→ <strong>No—only those lacking clear, objective standards;
physical‑destruction bans tied to fire safety or property interests may
pass muster.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Why not decide the First‑Amendment question
directly?”<br />
→ <strong>Powell prefers the <strong>narrowest‑grounds rule</strong>;
once vagueness suffices, no need to reach broader speech
issues.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “How does Goguen fit into the later
<em>Texas v. Johnson</em> narrative?”<br />
→ <strong>Goguen softens the ground: it strips away vague ‘disrespect’
statutes, forcing states into narrower bans that <em>Johnson</em> will
later strike on <strong>content‑based grounds</strong>.</strong></p>

<em>Airport Comm'rs v. Jews for Jesus</em>, 482 U.S. 569 (1987)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts / Procedural Posture</strong><br />
– In <strong>1983</strong> the <strong>Los Angeles Board of Airport
Commissioners</strong> adopted <strong>Resolution No. 13787</strong>
declaring that the entire <strong>Central Terminal Area (CTA) of LAX “is
not open for First Amendment activities”</strong> and directing the City
Attorney to sue anyone engaged in such conduct. – On
<strong>July 6 1984</strong> <strong>Alan “Avi” Snyder</strong>, a
minister with <strong>Jews for Jesus, Inc.</strong>, was stopped while
handing out free religious leaflets on an outdoor pedestrian ramp; an
airport officer showed him the resolution and ordered him off the
premises. – Snyder and Jews for Jesus sued in the
<strong>C.D. California</strong> for declaratory and injunctive relief,
alleging the rule was facially unconstitutional, vague, and
discriminatorily enforced. The district court (on stipulated facts) held
the CTA a public forum and struck the rule; the <strong>Ninth Circuit
affirmed</strong>. SCOTUS granted cert.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Petitioner’s Theory (Board of Airport
Commissioners)</strong><br />
– <strong>Airport‑security &amp; traffic‑flow</strong> justify a
<strong>total ban</strong>; LAX terminals are, at most, a
<strong>nonpublic forum</strong>, so regulations need only be
<strong>reasonable and viewpoint‑neutral</strong>.<br />
– Overbreadth doctrine does not apply because the Board intended the
rule to cover only <strong>non‑airport‑related expressive
activity</strong> that could impede operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Respondents’ Theory (Jews for Jesus &amp;
Snyder)</strong><br />
– Resolution is <strong>facially overbroad</strong>: it criminalizes
even silent prayer, wearing a political button, or casual conversation;
no narrowing construction possible.<br />
– Even in a nonpublic forum an <strong>absolute speech ban</strong> is
unreasonable and violates the First Amendment; the rule also invites
<strong>selective enforcement</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does Resolution 13787 violate the <strong>First Amendment</strong>
by banning all “First Amendment activities” inside LAX’s central
terminal?</li>
<li>Must the Court decide whether an airport terminal is a
<strong>public forum</strong> before resolving the challenge?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Holdings / Vote Map</strong><br />
– <strong>9 – 0</strong> (Opinion:
<strong>O’Connor, J.</strong>) → <strong>Resolution facially violates
the First Amendment under the overbreadth doctrine</strong>; judgment of
Ninth Circuit affirmed.<br />
– <strong>White, J. (joined by Rehnquist, C.J.) concurring</strong>:
agrees on overbreadth, but would emphasize that airports are not
traditional public fora.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Majority Reasoning (Justice O’Connor)</strong><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Overbreadth Framework</strong><br />
– A law is invalid if its <strong>“plain language”</strong> prohibits
<strong>a substantial amount of protected speech</strong> relative to
its legitimate sweep (<em>Broadrick</em>, <em>Ferber</em>).<br />
<strong>Step 2 – Application to Resolution 13787</strong><br />
– Text bars <strong>“all First Amendment activities”</strong>:
encompasses political discussion, reading a newspaper, humming a
hymn—speech that could not conceivably endanger airport safety.<br />
– Such a sweeping ban would be unconstitutional <strong>even in a
nonpublic forum</strong> because <strong>no governmental
interest</strong> justifies eliminating <em>all</em> expression.<br />
<strong>Step 3 – No Saving Construction</strong><br />
– Board’s invitation to infer a “speech‑unrelated‑to‑airport‑purposes”
gloss is too <strong>vague</strong> and <strong>delegates unfettered
discretion</strong> to airport police; Court declines to rewrite the
ordinance.<br />
<strong>Step 4 – Forum Status Unnecessary</strong><br />
– Because the regulation is <strong>patently overbroad</strong>, the
Court need <strong>not decide</strong> whether LAX’s CTA is a
traditional, designated, or nonpublic forum.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>White Concurrence (joined by Rehnquist C.J.)</strong><br />
– Airports are typically <strong>nonpublic fora</strong>; the Board
could enact <strong>reasonable, content‑neutral time‑place‑manner
limits</strong> focused on congestion—but a total ban overshoots.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of Scrutiny Applied</strong><br />
– <strong>Facial overbreadth / reasonableness test</strong>: even the
minimal standard for nonpublic fora condemns an <strong>absolute,
content‑neutral but total</strong> prohibition on speech.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance / Immediate Fallout</strong><br />
– Landmark reminder that <strong>government may not adopt a blanket
speech embargo</strong> on its property, no matter the forum
classification.<br />
– Invigorated the <strong>overbreadth doctrine</strong> as a swift tool
to strike facial bans, forcing governments to craft <strong>narrow,
objective rules</strong> (e.g., designated leafleting zones, permit
systems).<br />
– Influenced later airport‑speech cases and analogous disputes in
transit hubs, shopping malls, and train stations; many authorities
rewrote rules to target <strong>specific disruptions</strong> rather
than expression per se.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socratic‑Class Landmines &amp; Answers</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “If the Court didn’t decide whether an airport is a public
forum, what guidance remains?”<br />
→ <strong>Any forum test still forbids an <em>absolute</em> ban;
agencies must tailor regulations to concrete harms like obstruction or
security, not to speech itself.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Could LAX limit leafleting to kiosks or curbside
areas?”<br />
→ **Probably yes—if the rule is <strong>content‑neutral, leaves ample
alternatives, and is tied to congestion or security
evidence.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Does this case make airports ‘free‑speech zones’?”<br />
→ <strong>No. It only invalidates a <em>total</em> prohibition;
reasonable, narrowly tailored restrictions remain
permissible.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Why is overbreadth different from vagueness?”<br />
→ <strong>Overbreadth protects <em>third‑party speakers</em> by striking
a statute that sweeps too widely; vagueness targets lack of clear
standards.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Would a ban on ‘distribution of literature that
interferes with passenger flow’ survive?”<br />
→ <strong>Maybe—Court would demand evidence that leafleting
<em>actually</em> disrupts operations and that the ban is no broader
than necessary.</strong></p>

v. Board of Regents</em>, 385 U.S. 589 (1967)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts / Procedural Posture</strong><br />
– New York’s <strong>Civil Service Law § 105</strong> and
<strong>Education Law § 3022 (the “Feinberg Law”)</strong> required
every teacher or professor employed by the State University of New York
to sign a <strong>“loyalty certificate”</strong> disavowing
Communist‑party membership and to affirm they had never advocated “the
overthrow of the government by force or violence.”<br />
– The Regents could list “subversive organizations”; <strong>mere
knowing membership</strong>—even without active advocacy—was grounds for
dismissal.<br />
– <strong>Harry Keyishian</strong> (English instructor) and four
SUNY‑Buffalo colleagues refused to sign; they were fired and sued for
declaratory and injunctive relief in the <strong>W.D. New York</strong>.
District court upheld the statutes; the <strong>Second Circuit
affirmed</strong> (2‑1). SCOTUS granted certiorari and heard argument
October 17‑18 1966.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State’s Theory (Board of Regents &amp; Attorney
General)</strong><br />
– The State has a <strong>compelling interest</strong> in preserving an
educational workforce loyal to constitutional government; § 105 targets
<strong>action, not opinion</strong>.<br />
– Statutes are patterned on <strong>clear federal precedents</strong>
(e.g., <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur</em>?) (They actually
relied on <em>Adler v. Board of Education</em>, 1952) and provide
adequate procedural safeguards: notice, opportunity to resign, review by
Commissioner of Education.<br />
– Academic employment is a <strong>privilege, not a right</strong>; the
State may attach reasonable conditions (no subversive activity) to that
privilege.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Petitioners’ Theory (Keyishian et al.)</strong><br />
– Laws are <strong>overbroad and vague</strong>: terms like
“treasonable,” “seditious,” “advocacy” lack objective content and chill
legitimate debate.<br />
– Punishing <strong>mere membership</strong> in a proscribed
group—without proof of specific intent—conflicts with <em>Noto</em>,
<em>Scales</em>, <em>Elfbrandt</em>.<br />
– Statutes impose an <strong>ideological orthodoxy</strong> on public
universities, violating the <strong>First Amendment’s core protection of
academic freedom</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol type="1">
<li>Do New York’s loyalty‑certificate and subversive‑membership
provisions violate the <strong>First and Fourteenth Amendments</strong>

<em>Adler</em> effectively overruled.</strong><br />
– <strong>Clark, Harlan, Stewart, White</strong> dissented (Clark
opinion).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Majority Reasoning (Justice Brennan)</strong><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Overbreadth &amp; Vagueness</strong><br />
– Statutes reach “<em>advocacy in the abstract</em>” and impose
liability for <strong>passive organizational membership</strong>—a
direct clash with <em>Noto</em> and <em>Elfbrandt</em>.<br />
– Key terms (“treasonable,” “seditious,” “utter before any class”)
provide <strong>no objective standards</strong>, leaving teachers to
guess at what speech risks dismissal—classic <em>Baggett</em>
vagueness.<br />
<strong>Step 2 – Academic Freedom as a First‑Amendment “Special
Concern”</strong><br />
– “<em>The classroom is peculiarly the marketplace of ideas.</em>”
Government may not cast a “pall of orthodoxy” over universities;
rigorous scrutiny applies.<br />
<strong>Step 3 – Overruling <em>Adler</em></strong><br />
– Experience since 1952 shows loyalty schemes <strong>chill debate far
beyond any legitimate security aim</strong>; <em>Adler</em>’s reasoning
incompatible with modern First‑Amendment doctrine.<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> Statutes facially invalid; reinstatement and
back‑pay relief left to lower courts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concurrence (Justice Douglas)</strong><br />
– Stresses that any <strong>ideological blacklist</strong> in public
employment offends the First Amendment, regardless of vagueness.
Academic freedom demands an <strong>absolute bar</strong> to such
loyalty requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissent (Justice Clark, joined by Harlan, Stewart,
White)</strong><br />
– States may demand <strong>“orthodox loyalty” to constitutional
processes</strong> from public servants; the Feinberg Law targets
<strong>conduct, not belief</strong>.<br />
– Terms are no vaguer than “obscenity” or “clear and present danger,”
and ample administrative review cures any marginal uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of Scrutiny Applied</strong><br />
– Effectively <strong>strict scrutiny</strong>: laws burden <strong>core
political speech</strong> in a uniquely sensitive forum (higher
education); state must show <strong>narrowly tailored means to a

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance / Immediate Fallout</strong><br />
– Landmark for <strong>academic freedom</strong>: First time the Court
constitutionalized the concept and invalidated loyalty oaths on that
basis.<br />
– Overruled <em>Adler</em>; accelerated dismantling of
<strong>McCarthy‑era teacher loyalty laws</strong> nationwide.<br />
– Foreshadowed later tilt against “guilt by association”
(<em>O’Hair</em>, <em>Roberts</em>).<br />
– Cited in countless faculty‑speech cases and in modern debates over
<strong>campus ideological mandates</strong>, showing Court’s skepticism
toward state‑imposed intellectual conformity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socratic‑Class Landmines &amp; Answers</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Why did the Court rely on vagueness rather than decide a
broad ‘academic‑freedom’ right?”<br />
→ <strong>Brennan used vagueness/overbreadth as <em>narrowest
grounds</em>, but embedded a robust academic‑freedom principle—making
the holding both doctrinally cautious and normatively
strong.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “How is this different from <strong>security
clearance</strong> loyalty checks for nuclear scientists?”<br />
→ <strong>Clearances review <em>specific conduct</em> and are handled in
camera; Feinberg banned even silent association and public classroom
speech, reaching far broader.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Does Keyishian mean states can never condition employment
on association?”<br />
→ <strong>No—under <em>Scales</em>, the state may act when it proves
<strong>knowing, active membership + specific intent to further unlawful
ends</strong>. Mere status is insufficient.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Would a statute targeting only <strong>active advocacy of
violent overthrow in class</strong> survive?” → <strong>Possibly—if
narrowly drawn, viewpoint‑neutral, and keyed to direct incitement
(<em>Brandenburg</em>) rather than abstract doctrine.</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “What if a professor openly leads a militant group calling
for insurrection?”<br />
→ <strong>State can discipline based on <strong>incitement / true
threat</strong> standards; Keyishian protects academic inquiry, not
violent conspiracies.</strong></p>

– Leaflet advocates <strong>peaceful political
opposition</strong>—petitioning to repeal the draft—not sabotage.<br />

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Majority Reasoning (Justice Holmes)</strong><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Contextual Lens</strong><br />
– <em>“The character of every act depends upon the circumstances in
which it is done.”</em> Wartime context amplifies the government’s
interest.<br />
<strong>Step 2 – Birth of the <em>Clear‑and‑Present‑Danger</em>
Test</strong><br />
– Speech is unprotected when its <strong>“words are used in such
circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present
danger that they will bring about ==the substantive evils Congress has a
right to prevent.==”</strong><br />
– Analogy: <em>falsely shouting fire in a crowded theatre</em>—speech’s
proximity &amp; likelihood of harm govern.<br />
<strong>Step 3 – Application</strong><br />
– Leaflet’s explicit call to <strong>oppose the draft</strong> during
active mobilization posed a danger both ==<strong>“clear” (imminent) and
“present” (proximate)</strong>.==<br />
<strong>Step 4 – First Amendment Scope</strong><br />
==– First Amendment is not absolute; it does not protect speech that
<strong>undermines lawful government functions in
wartime.</strong>==</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scrutiny Level</strong><br />
– Not yet “strict scrutiny”; rather an <strong>ad‑hoc balancing</strong>
strongly deferential to wartime legislative judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance / Legacy</strong><br />
– First articulation of the <strong>Clear‑and‑Present‑Danger
test</strong>, soon re‑examined in <em>Abrams</em> (Holmes dissent) and
refined in <em>Whitney</em> (Brandeis concurrence).<br />
– Illustrates early <strong>Holmes‑Brandeis civil‑libertarian
evolution</strong>: unanimous here, but their views liberalize within a
single year.<br />
– Framework survives through the 1920s–40s until supplanted by
<strong>“incitement to imminent lawless action”</strong> in
<em>Brandenburg v. Ohio</em> (1969).<br />
– Stands as canonical example of <strong>wartime speech
restrictions</strong> and the tension between security and dissent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socratic‑Class Landmines &amp; Answers</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> If the leaflets had advocated only <strong>repeal</strong>
of the draft but not <strong>resistance</strong>, same result?<br />
→ Probably not; Holmes emphasizes the <em>practical obstruction</em>
language. Pure policy advocacy would be protected.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> How “clear” is “clear”—does a single leaflet
suffice?<br />
→ Holmes never quantifies; later cases (<em>Debs</em>, <em>Abrams</em>,
<em>Gitlow</em>) show Court sliding toward abstract ideological
punishments until <em>Brandenburg</em>.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> Where does incorporation stand?<br />
→ <em>Schenck</em> binds only the <strong>federal</strong> government;
states were unrestricted until <em>Gitlow</em> (1925) began selective
incorporation.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> Could Congress criminalize <strong>possession</strong> of
anti‑draft literature?<br />
→ Under <em>Schenck</em>, perhaps yes during war, but modern doctrine
demands <strong>advocacy + imminence</strong>.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> Does “fire‑in‑a‑theatre” still govern?<br />
→ Rhetorically famous, doctrinally outdated; modern incitement test is
<em>Brandenburg</em>’s <strong>intent + imminence + likelihood</strong>
triad.</p>

<p><strong>Facts / Procedural Posture</strong><br />
– 1948‑49: <strong>Eugene Dennis</strong> (General Secretary, Communist
Party USA) and 10 other party leaders indicted in the
<strong>S.D.N.Y.</strong> for <strong>conspiracy to violate § 2(a)(1) of
the Smith Act</strong> (advocating the violent overthrow of the U.S.
government).<br />
– Lengthy nine‑month jury trial before Judge <strong>Harold
Medina</strong>; prosecution rested largely on FBI informants &amp;
Marxist‑Leninist texts. All defendants convicted; received 3–5‑year
sentences.<br />
– <strong>Second Circuit (Hand, J.)</strong> affirms, adopting the
famous ==“gravity of the evil, discounted by its improbability”==

– SCOTUS argument Dec. 4‑7 1950; decision June 4 1951, at the height of
Korean War &amp; McCarthy hearings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Government’s Theory (Attorney General J. Howard

– <strong>Communist Party is a disciplined conspiratorial
apparatus</strong> seeking to foment revolution when geopolitically
opportune; leadership’s teachings pose a <strong>latent but grave
threat</strong>.<br />
– No First‑Amendment immunity for a <strong>conspiracy</strong> to
advocate illegal violence; Congress validly acted to <strong>neutralize
subversive organizations</strong> before they strike.<br />
– Courts must weigh <strong>national survival</strong>; cannot wait for
the “certainly impending” spark.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Defendants’ Theory (Dennis et al.)</strong><br />
– Indictment punishes <strong>speech and belief, not action</strong>;
teaching Marxism is protected advocacy of political theory.<br />
– Smith Act overbroad &amp; vague; violates
<strong>clear‐and‑present‑danger</strong> standard of
<em>Schneider</em>, <em>Thomas v. Collins</em>, <em>Bridges</em>.<br />
– First Amendment demands proof of <strong>imminent incitement</strong>;
prosecution showed only academic discussion and party texts.</p>

enough,</strong> government need not await near‑certainty.==
<strong>Step 2 – Distinguish Abstract Doctrine vs. Active
Conspiracy</strong><br />
– Defendants are ==<strong>not mere philosophers</strong>;== they lead a
hierarchical organization committed to Leninist discipline.
– <em>“==Advocacy”</em> under Smith Act means <strong>organizing for
action</strong>,== not casual discussion.<br />
<strong>Step 3 – Judicial Role in National Security</strong><br />
– Courts must acknowledge <strong>Congressional/executive
intelligence</strong> on Communist tactics; deferential but not
rubber‑stamp.<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> Present danger <strong>adequate</strong>; First
Amendment yields to collective security.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Frankfurter Concurrence (joined by Jackson)</strong><br />
– Advocates explicit <strong>balancing test</strong>: courts must weigh
<strong>society’s right to self‑preservation</strong> against

– Warns against “absolutism” of First Amendment; endorses
<strong>legislative fact‑finding</strong> on subversive threats.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jackson Concurrence (solo)</strong><br />
– Frames defendants as ==akin to <strong>enemy agents</strong>;==
stresses <strong>conspiracy</strong> as actionable independent of overt
incitement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissent (Justice Black)</strong><br />
– First Amendment is <strong>absolute</strong>: Congress may punish only
<strong>direct incitement or action</strong>, not teaching.<br />
– Balancing “gravity” vs. “probability” hands judges a <strong>censor’s
veto</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dissent (Justice Douglas)</strong><br />
– Danger here is <strong>too remote</strong>; free society must risk
“misguided orthodoxy” to preserve liberty. – Smith Act collapses
distinction between <strong>doctrine and advocacy</strong>; cites
Jefferson’s “error of opinion may be tolerated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of Scrutiny</strong><br />
– Effectively a <strong>Hand‑style ad‑hoc balancing</strong> ≈
intermediate scrutiny weighted by national security; far from modern
<em>Brandenburg</em> strictness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance / Fallout</strong><br />
– <strong>High‑water mark of Cold‑War repression</strong>; legitimated
broad anti‑Communist prosecutions.<br />
– Soon retrenched: <strong><em>Yates v. U.S.</em> (1957)</strong>
narrows “advocacy,” insisting on <strong>“urge to
action.”</strong><br />
– Overruled in effect by <strong><em>Brandenburg v. Ohio</em>
(1969)</strong> (imminent‑lawless‑action test).<br />
– Exposed fissures in First‑Amendment theory: <strong>absolutism vs.
balancing</strong>; seeded modern doctrine that <strong>abstract
advocacy is protected</strong>.<br />
– Political echo: fueled McCarthyism yet also provoked intellectual
backlash leading to cases like <strong><em>Keyishian</em></strong>
(1967) and <strong><em>Braynen</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socratic‑Class Landmines &amp; Answers</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> Are <em>Dennis</em> and <em>Schenck</em> formally
overruled?<br />
→ <em>Dennis</em>’s test is explicitly rejected by <em>Brandenburg</em>;
<em>Schenck</em>’s result survives only where speech meets
<strong>incitement + imminence + likelihood</strong>.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> Why didn’t the Court require <strong>proof of an overt
act</strong>?<br />
→ Conspiracy law criminalizes <strong>agreement plus intent</strong>;
plurality viewed Party structure itself as <strong>“clear and
present”</strong>.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> Could the same prosecution succeed today?<br />
→ Unlikely: <em>Brandenburg</em> demands <strong>specific intent to
produce imminent lawless action</strong>; abstract Marxist seminars are
protected.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> What doctrinal thread links <em>Schenck</em>,
<em>Dennis</em>, <em>Keyishian</em>, <em>Brandenburg</em>?<br />
→ An arc from <strong>wartime deference</strong> → <strong>Cold War
balancing</strong> → <strong>academic‑freedom recognition</strong> →
<strong>robust incitement standard</strong> safeguarding ideological
speech.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> Does <em>Dennis</em> permit suppression of <strong>ISIS
online propaganda</strong>?<br />
→ Only if government shows <strong>direct incitement of imminent
terrorist acts</strong>; modern courts apply <em>Holder v. Humanitarian
Law Project</em> (2010) and <em>Brandenburg</em>.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> Is <em>Hand’s formula</em> dead?<br />
→ As First‑Amendment doctrine, yes; but echoes survive in
<strong>national‑security FISA warrants</strong> and
<strong>material‑support statutes</strong>, where courts still weigh
<strong>severity vs. likelihood</strong> under a rational‑basis‑plus
lens.</p>

<em>Brandenburg v. Ohio</em>, 395 U.S. 444 (1969)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facts / Procedural Posture</strong><br />
– <strong>Clarence Brandenburg</strong>, a Klan “Imperial Wizard” from
rural Ohio, invited a Cincinnati TV reporter to film a
==<strong>cross‑burning rally</strong>== on a farm in Hamilton County
(June 1964).<br />
– The broadcast showed hooded speakers railing ==against Blacks and
Jews== and warning that if the government continued to “suppress the
white Caucasian race,” there might have to be “revengeance” against
Congress, the President, and the Court.<br />
– Brandenburg was charged under <strong>Ohio Rev. Code § 2923.13
(Criminal Syndicalism)</strong>, which outlawed advocating “crime,
sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism” to effect
political change and assembling with any group formed to teach or
advocate such doctrine.<br />
– <strong>County Court</strong> convicted; sentence: $1,000 fine plus
1–10 years. Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed; <strong>Ohio Supreme Court
dismissed</strong> without opinion. SCOTUS noted probable jurisdiction;
argument Feb. 27 1969; decision June 9 1969.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>State’s Theory (Prosecutor &amp; Ohio AG)</strong><br />
– The statute mirrors <strong>Whitney</strong> and
<strong>Dennis</strong>; it punishes <strong>advocacy, not mere abstract
doctrine</strong>, of violent overthrow.<br />
– Brandenburg’s own words and affiliation with the Klan create a
sufficient <strong>danger to public order</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Petitioner’s Theory (Brandenburg)</strong><br />
– Speech was <strong>political hyperbole</strong> with no call to
<em>immediate</em> violence; statute punishes mere abstract advocacy,
violating the <strong>First &amp; Fourteenth Amendments</strong>.<br />
– <strong>Yates</strong> and <strong>Noto</strong> require proof of
<em>incitement to action</em>, not abstract teaching.</p>

<p><strong>Holding / Vote Map</strong><br />

– Conviction <strong>reversed</strong>; <strong>statute unconstitutional
==on its face</strong>.==<br />
– <strong>Black &amp; Douglas</strong> each filed short concurrences
emphasizing absolutism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Core Reasoning (Per Curiam)</strong><br />
<strong>Step 1 – Jettison the “Balancing” of
<em>Dennis</em></strong><br />
– Re‑examines <em>Whitney</em> and <em>Dennis</em>; rules that
<strong>mere advocacy of abstract doctrine is not enough</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 2 – Announce the <em>Brandenburg</em> Incitement
Standard</strong><br />
– *“The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not
permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of
law violation ==<strong>except</strong> where such advocacy is directed
to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite
or produce such action.”== – Two prongs: <strong>(i)
Intent/Direction</strong> and <strong>(ii)
Imminence/Likelihood.</strong><br />
<strong>Step 3 – Apply to Facts</strong><br />
– Brandenburg’s statements, although racist and violent in tone, were
<strong>conditional and future‑oriented</strong>; ==no imminent mob, no
concrete plan, thus protected.==<br />
<strong>Step 4 – Overrule Sub Silentio</strong><br />
– Explicitly <strong>overrules <em>Whitney v. California</em>
(1927)</strong>; implicitly guts <em>Dennis</em> balancing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concurrences</strong><br />
– <strong>Black</strong>: First Amendment bars any punishment for mere
advocacy; ==rejects all “clear‑and‑present‑danger” formulations.==<br />
– <strong>Douglas</strong>: Balancing speech against security invites
censorship; only ==**“hot” incitement== may be punished.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of Scrutiny / Doctrine Articulated</strong><br />
– Establishes the modern <strong>“Imminent‑Lawless‑Action”
test</strong>—effectively <strong>strict scrutiny plus temporal and
probabilistic filters</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance / Fallout</strong><br />
– Canonical pivot from <strong>hand‑waving balancing</strong> to a
<strong>bright‑line test</strong> that protects even extremist
advocacy.<br />
– Framework now governs everything from <strong>terror‑recruitment
cases</strong> to <strong>social‑media exhortations</strong>.<br />
– Influential progeny: <em>Hess</em> (1973), <em>NAACP v. Claiborne
Hardware</em> (1982), <em>Bible Believers</em> (6th Cir. 2015).<br />
– Cited to show that <strong>“hate speech” is protected unless it meets
the <em>Brandenburg</em> standard</strong>—fueling campus‑speech debates
and online‑platform policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socratic‑Class Landmines &amp; Answers</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Does <em>Brandenburg</em> protect direct instructions to
build bombs posted online?”<br />
→ Only if there is <strong>no intent or likelihood of immediate
use</strong>; otherwise, <em>Holder v. HLP</em> &amp;
<strong>material‑support statutes</strong> apply.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> “How ‘imminent’ is ‘imminent’?”<br />
→ Seconds or minutes, not days; <strong>abstraction ≠ imminence</strong>
(see <em>Hess</em>: ‘We’ll take the streets <strong>later</strong>’ is
protected).<br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Does the decision rely on viewpoint neutrality?”<br />
→ Yes. Statute failed to distinguish <strong>abstract doctrine vs.
incitement</strong> and thus was viewpoint‑based and overbroad.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> “What if Brandenburg had handed out weapons at the
rally?”<br />
→ Act plus intent → <strong>unprotected incitement +
aiding‑and‑abetting</strong>; criminal liability stands.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Is <em>Brandenburg</em> absolute?”<br />
→ No; <strong>“true threats,” “fighting words,” and speech integral to

clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.”==
– Enumerates <strong>unprotected categories</strong>: ==obscenity,

<strong>Step 3 – Apply to Chaplinsky</strong><br />
– “God‑damned racketeer” / “damned Fascist” directed face‑to‑face at an
officer = classic fighting words; statute, as narrowed, punishes only
that subset, so <strong>no overbreadth or vagueness.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Level of Scrutiny</strong><br />
– No balancing; <strong>categorical exclusion</strong>: fighting words

<p><strong>Significance / Subsequent Doctrine</strong><br />
– Landmark creation of the <strong>Fighting‑Words

<li><strong>Cohen v. California</strong> (1971) – “F*** the Draft”
jacket <strong>protected</strong> (not a face‑to‑face insult).</li>
<li><strong>Gooding v. Wilson</strong> (1972), <strong>Lewis v. New
Orleans</strong> (1974) – statutes voided for overbreadth.</li>
<li><strong>R.A.V. v. St. Paul</strong> (1992) – Viewpoint‑based bans on

– Modern courts seldom uphold convictions on pure fighting‑words
grounds; doctrine survives mainly in <strong>assaultive face‑to‑face

</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socratic‑Class Landmines &amp; Answers</strong><br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Why is ‘F*** the Draft’ protected but ‘You’re a damned
Fascist’ not?”<br />
→ <strong>Audience &amp; focus</strong>: Cohen’s message was
<strong>political, general, non‑confrontational</strong>; Chaplinsky’s
was a <strong>direct personal epithet</strong> likely to trigger
violence.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Does Chaplinsky survive <em>R.A.V.</em>?”<br />
→ The <em>category</em> survives; but regulations must be
<strong>content‑ and viewpoint‑neutral</strong>—no targeting specific
ideologies.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Difference between fighting words and ‘true
threats’?”<br />
→ <em>True threat</em>: speaker <strong>intends</strong> to instill fear
of bodily harm; <em>fighting words</em>: likely to <strong>provoke
target to violence</strong>.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> “If Chaplinsky had shouted the same words online?”<br />
→ Likely <strong>protected</strong>; absence of immediate physical
confrontation undermines the fighting‑words rationale.<br />
– <em>Q:</em> “Can states criminalize hate slurs as fighting
words?”<br />
→ Only if the statute is <strong>neutral</strong> (covers all epithets)
and speech is <strong>face‑to‑face</strong>, <strong>likely to

<strong><em>Miller v. California</em>, 413 U.S. 15 (1973)</strong></h3>
<p>— <em>Burger Court redraws the map of “obscenity,” coining the
three‑part <strong>Miller test</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Facts &amp; Procedural Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1969‑70 → <strong>Marvin Miller</strong> runs a direct‑mail “adult”
business in Southern California.</li>
<li>Five catalog brochures—packed with graphic photos entitled
<em>Intercourse</em>, <em>Man‑Woman</em>, <em>Sex Orgies
Illustrated</em>, <em>An Illustrated History of Pornography</em>, plus
the film <em>Marital Intercourse</em>—are mailed unsolicited to a
Newport Beach restaurant; the manager’s mother also sees them and calls
police.</li>
<li>Charged under <strong>Cal. Pen. Code § 311.2(a)</strong> (knowingly
distributing obscene matter).</li>
<li><strong>Orange County jury</strong> convicts; Superior Court imposes
a fine + prison term (sentence stayed).</li>
<li>Appellate Dept., Superior Court affirms without opinion; California
Supreme Court denies review.</li>
<li><strong>SCOTUS</strong> notes probable jurisdiction (Jan 1972),
argues Nov 7 1972; reargued Jan 18 1973; decision
<strong>June 21 1973</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>State’s Theory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brochures graphically depict “hard‑core” sexual acts; no artistic or
literary merit; statute tracks <em>Roth</em> and <em>Memoirs</em>
standards; California has a compelling interest in shielding unwilling
recipients.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miller’s Theory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mailings protected by the First Amendment; existing “utterly without
redeeming social value” standard (from <em>Memoirs</em>) not satisfied;
statute fails to give fair notice or require national standards →
unconstitutional vagueness/overbreadth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues Presented</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What constitutional test should govern state regulation of obscenity
after <em>Roth</em>, <em>Memoirs</em>, and <em>Stanley</em>?</li>
<li>Does California’s conviction violate the First and Fourteenth
Amendments?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5 – 4</strong> (Burger, White, Blackmun, Powell,
Rehnquist ⇢ majority; Douglas, Brennan, Stewart,
Marshall ⇢ dissent).</li>
<li>Conviction <strong>vacated and remanded</strong> (because jury
applied the wrong, too‑lenient “social‑value” test); <strong>California
statute survives</strong> so long as it incorporates the new
standard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Reasoning (Burger, C.J.)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Rejection of “Social‑Value” &amp; National‑Standard
formulas</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Memoirs</em> rule (“utterly without redeeming social value”)
proved unworkable; jury confusion + deluge of appeals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Announcement of the <strong>Miller Test</strong></strong>
<blockquote>
<p>“The First Amendment allows regulation <em>only</em> of works that,
<strong>taken as a whole</strong>:<br />
 <strong>(a)</strong> appeal to the <em>prurient interest</em> of an
<strong>average person applying contemporary <em>community</em>
standards</strong>;<br />
 <strong>(b)</strong> depict or describe <strong>patently
offensive</strong> sexual conduct <em>specifically defined by state
law</em>; and  <strong>(c)</strong> <strong>lack serious Literary,
Artistic, Political, or Scientific (SLAPS) value</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Community Variability</strong>
<ul>
<li>National uniformity is impossible; what Maine must tolerate need not
equal Las Vegas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fair Notice &amp; Enumerated Conduct</strong>
<ul>
<li>States must spell out in the statute—or authoritative judicial
construction—the sexual acts subject to prohibition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>
<ul>
<li>California courts used an outdated test; case remanded for
reassessment under the new standard.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Brennan’s Dissent (joined by Stewart &amp;
Marshall)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Concedes personal exhaustion with obscenity line‑drawing; now favors
<strong>full First‑Amendment protection</strong> for adult pornography
absent direct assault on juveniles or unwilling viewers.</li>
<li>Predicts continued “institutional stress” and chilling effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>==Douglas Dissent==</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Obscenity” never appears in the Constitution; censorship must
come—if at all—via amendment, not judicial invention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SLAPS</strong> replaces “utterly without” test.</li>
<li><strong>Community standards = local</strong>, not national, but
SLAPS value judged by a <strong>reasonable national jury</strong>,
preserving some objectivity.</li>
<li>Crime requires <strong>depiction of sexual conduct</strong>, not
mere profanity/nudity.</li>
<li>Jury still fact‑finder; judges supply limiting instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact &amp; Legacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Obscenity prosecutions revived (e.g., “Deep Throat,” 1976).</li>
<li><strong>“Miller test”</strong> governs U.S. obscenity law to present
day; survives technological shifts (VHS, internet).</li>
<li>Online era: courts wrestle with which “community” applies in
cyberspace; some circuits adopt an “interested community” approach,
others national for prong (a).</li>
<li>Content‑platform policies (YouTube, OnlyFans) silently embed Miller
criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Socratic Traps &amp; Answers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Q: Do community standards vary within a state?</em> → Yes; jury
reflects its jurisdiction’s norms.</li>
<li><em>Q: Does SLAPS value look to local views?</em> → No; objective,
<em>reasonable‑person</em> perspective.</li>
<li><em>Q: What about violent but non‑sexual gore?</em> → Not obscenity;
analyze under general indecency/harm provisions.</li>
<li><em>Q: Is child pornography covered?</em> → No; separate categorical
exclusion <em>New York v. Ferber</em> (1982).</li>
<li><em>Q: Can “mere nudity” be obscene?</em> → Rarely; prurient +
patently offensive + SLAPS‑less threshold rarely met by simple
nudity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mnemonic</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“P‑P‑S / S‑L‑A‑P‑S”</strong> → <em>Prurient, Patently
offensive, Specific conduct &amp; Lacks Serious
Literary‑Artistic‑Political‑Scientific value</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong><br />
Miller institutionalized a three‑pronged <strong>local‑standards +
SLAPS</strong> framework: only the most graphic, valueless sexual
depictions aimed at arousal fall outside First‑Amendment protection;
mere offensiveness or nudity does not suffice.</p>

<strong><em>Cohen v. California</em>, 403 U.S. 15 (1971)</strong></h3>
<p>— <em>The Court’s ode to the emotive power of four‑letter
words</em></p>
<p><strong>Facts &amp; Procedural Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>April 26 1968</strong> → <strong>Paul Robert Cohen</strong>,
19‑year‑old Vietnam‑war critic, enters the <strong>Los Angeles County
Courthouse</strong> corridor wearing a jacket hand‑painted
<strong>“F</strong>k the Draft.”**</li>
<li>No chanting, no leaflets, no threats; women and children
present.</li>
<li>Arrested under <strong>Cal. Pen. Code § 415</strong>: “maliciously
and willfully disturb the peace … by offensive conduct.”</li>
<li><strong>Municipal Court</strong> convicts; sentence: 30 days in
jail.</li>
<li><strong>California Court of Appeal</strong> affirms, defining jacket
as “offensive conduct.” State Supreme Court denies review.</li>
<li><strong>SCOTUS</strong> grants certiorari (Oct 1969), hears argument
Feb 22 1971; decision <strong>June 7 1971</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>California’s Position</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The jacket’s language is <strong>likely to provoke violence</strong>
(“fighting words”) or at least shocks captive observers; courthouse
demands decorum; statute valid.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cohen’s Position</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pure political expression; word is vulgar but <strong>not</strong>
obscene or directed at anyone; passers‑by can avert eyes; statute void
for vagueness &amp; overbreadth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does punishing display of a single profane word on a jacket violate
free‑speech guarantees?</li>
<li>Are “offensive” words outside First‑Amendment protection absent
obscenity, threats, or incitement?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>6 – 3</strong> (Harlan II writes; joined by Douglas,
Brennan, Stewart, White, Marshall).</li>
<li>Conviction <strong>reversed</strong>; § 415 unconstitutional ==as
applied.==</li>
<li><strong>Dissent (Blackmun, joined by Burger &amp; Black)</strong>:
jacket ≈ conduct; falls within <em>Chaplinsky</em> “fighting
words.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Majority Reasoning (Harlan)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>This is Speech, Not Conduct</strong> – Only the
communicative content was punished; no disruptive actions.</li>
<li><strong>Not Obscenity, Not Fighting Words</strong> – “F‑‑‑” lacks
erotic detail (<strong>Roth</strong>), and message not aimed at any
particular listener (<strong>Chaplinsky</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>No Captive‑Audience Problem</strong> – Brief exposure in a
public corridor; people can simply <strong>“avert their eyes.”</strong>
-- Not fighting words</li>
<li><strong>Emotive &amp; Cognitive Dimensions of Speech</strong> – The
Constitution guards not just ideas but the <strong>intensity</strong>
with which they are expressed; one man’s vulgarity is another’s
lyric.</li>
<li><strong>Slippery‑Slope / Boundless Censor’s Veto</strong> – If this
word is banned, where stop? Government cannot sanitize public debate to
placate the squeamish.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Public Morality vs. Free Expression</strong> –
“[A]n undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not
enough.” Regulation must fit within narrow historical exceptions; § 415
sweeps too broadly.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Blackmun Dissent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Labels episode “absurd and immature antic” closer to conduct than
speech; courthouse merits heightened civility; sees fit under
<em>Chaplinsky</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Significance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>==<strong>“Offensiveness” ≠ unprotected</strong>:== creates robust
shield for profanity in public discourse.</li>
<li>Clarifies limits of captive‑audience doctrine; seeds later cases
(<em>FCC v. Pacifica</em> limits broadcast, but distinguishes Cohen’s
political context).</li>
<li>Emphasizes <strong>viewpoint and content neutrality</strong>: state
cannot punish because listeners are offended.</li>
<li>Distinction cemented between <strong>obscenity</strong> (sexual
content) and <strong>indecency/profanity</strong> (linguistic
offensiveness).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ripple Effects &amp; Modern Use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cited whenever governments attempt to ban bumper stickers, band
t‑shirts, or protest signs with profanity (<em>City of Erie v. Pap’s
A.M.</em>, 2000; <em>Iancu v. Brunetti</em>, 2019 trademark case).</li>
<li>Forms backbone of campus‑speech guidelines: emotional, even vulgar
dissent is constitutionally sacrosanct.</li>
<li>Internet era: platforms generally tolerating expletives rely on
Cohen’s rationale for non‑erotic profanity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Classroom Hot‑Seat Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Q: Could a judge expel Cohen from the courtroom itself?</em> →
Possibly; courtroom is a non‑public forum with decorum rules, provided
regulation is content‑neutral and narrowly tailored.</li>
<li><em>Q: What if Cohen’s jacket targeted a person (“F‑‑‑
Judge Smith”)?</em> → Moves toward <strong>“true threat” /
fighting‑words</strong> territory; context matters.</li>
<li><em>Q: Do schools get Cohen protection?</em> → Not wholly;
<em>Fraser</em> (1986) allowed school discipline for lewd speech;
students’ rights not “coextensive” with adults.</li>
<li><em>Q: Broadcast radio?</em> → <em>Pacifica</em> (1978) allowed FCC
to fine for mid‑day expletives due to pervasive/accessible medium and
child audience.</li>
<li><em>Q: Hate slur instead of “F‑‑‑”?</em> → Still protected unless it
is a <strong>direct, personal insult</strong> likely to provoke violence
(<em>Chaplinsky</em>) or meets <em>Brandenburg</em> incitement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mnemonic</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Cohen = Coat + Curse ≠ Crime.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong><br />
The First Amendment shelters even raw, four‑letter political outbursts
in public spaces. Government may regulate obscenity, threats, or direct
incitement—but <strong>mere offensiveness is not a constitutional trump
card</strong>.</p>

<strong><em>Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser</em>, 478 U.S. 675 (1986)</strong></h3>
<p>— <em>Where the Court carved a First‑Amendment “lewd‑speech”
exception inside the schoolhouse gate</em></p>
<p><strong>Facts &amp; Procedural Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>April 26 1983</strong> → <strong>Matthew N. Fraser</strong>,
Bethel High School junior, delivers a 1‑minute nomination speech for a
classmate at a <strong>mandatory, school‑sponsored assembly</strong>
(≈ 600 students, many only 14). The speech brims with explicit sexual
double‑entendre (“firm in his pants… to the very end—the climax—for each
and every one of you”).</li>
<li>Reaction: laughter, cat‑calls—<strong>no fights, no
mayhem</strong>.</li>
<li>Discipline: assistant principal cites Bethel’s rule against
“obscene, profane language or gestures,” suspends Fraser <strong>three
days</strong> and <strong>removes him from the commencement‑speaker
ballot</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. District Court (W.D. Wash.)</strong> finds a
<strong>§ 1983 violation</strong>, deems rule vague/overbroad, awards
nominal damages.</li>
<li><strong>Ninth Circuit (Tang, J.)</strong> affirms: speech was
political; <strong><em>Tinker</em></strong> governs; no material
disruption.</li>
<li><strong>SCOTUS</strong> grants cert. <strong>Nov 12 1985</strong>,
hears argument <strong>Mar 3 1986</strong>, decides
<strong>Jul 7 1986</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>School District’s Position</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Schools inculcate civility; sexual vulgarity offends captive minors;
educators act <em>in loco parentis</em>; rule targets <strong>manner,
not viewpoint</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fraser’s Position</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pure political endorsement; no obscenity; no significant disruption;
rule void for vagueness/overbreadth; <em>Tinker</em> protects absent
material interference.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>May public‑school officials punish a student for lewd, sexual
metaphors at a compulsory assembly even without substantial
disruption?</li>
<li>How does <em>Tinker</em>’s “material and substantial interference”
test interact with vulgar, non‑political student speech?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>7 – 2</strong>. <strong>Burger, C.J.</strong> (joined by
White, Powell, Rehnquist, O’Connor, Blackmun, Stevens†) upholds
discipline; reverses Ninth Circuit.</li>
<li><strong>Brennan</strong> concurs in judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Dissent</strong>: <strong>Stevens</strong> (joined by
Marshall).</li>
<li><strong>Rule</strong>: Public schools may sanction student speech
that is <strong>lewd, vulgar, or plainly offensive</strong> and
incompatible with the “fundamental values of public‑school education,”
without proving <em>Tinker</em>‑level disruption.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Majority Reasoning (Burger)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Civility Mission</strong> – Echoes Jefferson/Ambach: schools
must teach “habits and manners of civility.”</li>
<li><strong><em>Tinker</em> Distinguished</strong> – Black‑armbands were
silent political protest; Fraser’s speech was intrusive sexual imagery
in front of minors.</li>
<li><strong>Per‑Se Lewdness Category</strong> – Vulgar sexual expression
bears “slight social value” (<em>Pacifica</em>, <em>Chaplinsky</em>
analogies); schools get wider latitude than public streets.</li>
<li><strong>Captive Audience &amp; <em>In Loco Parentis</em></strong> –
Assembly forced attendance; 14‑year‑olds lacked realistic “avert the
ear” option.</li>
<li><strong>No Viewpoint Discrimination</strong> – Sanction addressed
<strong>mode</strong>, not Fraser’s support for his candidate.</li>
<li><strong>Proportional Penalties</strong> – Three‑day suspension and
lost speaking honor are educational, not punitive imprisonment.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Brennan Concurrence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Discipline permissible <em>here</em> because decorum expectations
were clear; cautions against equating innuendo with obscenity; ==outside
school, <strong><em>Cohen</em></strong> would control.==</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stevens–Marshall Dissent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vagueness/Overbreadth</strong> – Rule gave no fair notice
that “metaphor” = “obscene.”</li>
<li><strong>No Real Disruption</strong> – Laughter ≠ material
interference; punishment excessive.</li>
<li>Courts shouldn’t constitutionalize etiquette; schools can teach
manners without suspensions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Significance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Establishes “<strong><em>Fraser</em> carve‑out</strong>”: lewd or
vulgar student speech is punishable <strong>per se</strong>,
sidestepping <em>Tinker</em>.</li>
<li>Forms second prong of the <strong>tripartite student‑speech
framework</strong> later crystallized in <em>Hazelwood</em> (curricular
speech) and <em>Morse</em> (drug‑advocacy).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ripple Effects &amp; Modern Use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upholds bans on profanity‑laden T‑shirts, sexually graphic posters,
explicit rap lyrics in class projects.</li>
<li>Digital era: circuits split on off‑campus social‑media vulgarity;
<em>Mahanoy Area v. B. L.</em> (2021) limits <em>Fraser</em> outside
school grounds.</li>
<li>Frequently cited in dress‑code and cheerleader‑banner cases to
justify discipline sans disruption evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Classroom Hot‑Seat Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Q: If Fraser had cursed school policy without sexual innuendo
(“This rule sucks!”)?</em> → Likely political speech; many courts would
require <em>Tinker</em> disruption showing.</li>
<li><em>Q: Does <em>Fraser</em> let schools ban “F‑‑‑” on student
clothing?</em> → Usually yes inside hallways; minors + captive audience
tip scale.</li>
<li><em>Q: Valedictorian recites risqué Shakespeare?</em> → If
pre‑screened, school may excise under <em>Hazelwood</em>; if rogue live,
post‑hoc discipline likely under <em>Fraser</em>.</li>
<li><em>Q: Universities?</em> → Generally no; college students are
adults; <em>Papish</em> (1973) applies fuller First‑Amendment
scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mnemonic</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Fraser = Filthy Figurative Flourish Forbidden in Front of
Fellow Freshmen.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong><br />
K‑12 educators may insist on decorum and <strong>punish lewd or sexually
explicit student speech</strong> even without proof of disruption.
<em>Fraser</em> narrows <em>Tinker</em>, carving a lewd‑speech exception
that anchors modern student‑expression doctrine.</p>

<li><strong>Mar 31 1966 → South Boston, MA:</strong> <strong>David Paul
O’Brien</strong>, 19 years old, and three companions publicly burn their
==Selective-Service draft cards== on the steps of the federal courthouse
before a crowd (including FBI agents).</li>
<li>Crowd attacks them; an agent brings O’Brien inside for safety.
O’Brien admits purpose was to persuade others to resist the draft.</li>
<li>Charged under the <strong>1965 amendment to § 12(b)(3) of the
Universal Military Training &amp; Service Act</strong> (50 U.S.C. App. §
462(b)(3)) — which, after 1965, ==criminalized <em>knowingly

<strong>First Circuit</strong> affirms.</li>
<li><strong>SCOTUS</strong> grants cert. Nov 13 1967; argued Jan 24
1968; decided <strong>May 27 1968</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Government’s Theory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draft cards are indispensable administrative tools; statute is
==content-neutral housekeeping==; disturbance to Selective-Service
machinery justifies prohibition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>O’Brien’s Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Burning was ==<strong>symbolic speech</strong> protesting the war==
⇒ First Amendment shields the act.</li>
<li>Statute’s ==“purpose” was to stifle anti-war expression== ⇒
unconstitutional content-based suppression.</li>
<li>Law is ==overbroad/vague==; less restrictive alternatives exist
(fine for failure to possess card, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Issues Presented</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does the First Amendment protect destruction of draft cards as
symbolic speech?</li>
<li>What standard governs statutes that penalize conduct with both
speech and non-speech elements?</li>
<li>Was § 462(b)(3) enacted to silence expression, rendering it
unconstitutional?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>8 – 1</strong> (Warren C.J.; joined by Black, Harlan,
Brennan, Stewart, White, Fortas, Marshall).</li>
<li><strong>Conviction affirmed</strong>: statute is constitutional as
applied.</li>
<li><strong>Douglas</strong> dissents (absolutist view: speech + conduct
inseparable; law suppresses dissent).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Reasoning (Warren, C.J.)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Definitional move</strong> — Not every conduct labeled
“speech” gets full immunity.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid-conduct framework</strong> — When <em>speech</em> and
<em>non-speech</em> elements are “combined,” government may regulate the
<em>non-speech</em> portion if four criteria are satisfied:
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> within constitutional power;
<strong>(2)</strong> furthers an <em>important/substantial</em>
governmental interest; <strong>(3)</strong> interest is <em>unrelated to
suppression of expression</em>; <strong>(4)</strong> incidental
restriction on First-Amendment freedoms is <em>no greater than
essential.</em> → <strong>The “O’Brien test.”</strong></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>
<ul>
<li>Congress has sweeping Art. I power to raise armies &amp; administer
Selective-Service.</li>
<li>Protecting cards’ availability is a substantial administrative
interest.</li>
<li>Interest is <em>content-neutral</em> — ==law bars all destruction,
pro- or anti-war.==</li>
<li>No narrower means will assure ready access to cards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Legislative motive</strong> — Even if some floor statements
reflected hostility to dissent, valid broad purposes control absent
proof of dominant censorship motive.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Douglas Dissent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draft cards are “identification papers of the kind ==so typical of
totalitarian regimes.==”</li>
<li>Burning is <em>pure speech</em> indistinguishable from uttered
protest; majority trivializes expressive element.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>O’Brien test = ==intermediate scrutiny</strong> for
content-neutral laws regulating expressive conduct.==</li>
<li>Distinguishes from <em>Texas v. Johnson</em> category (content-based
suppression) and from <em>Miller</em> obscenity.</li>
<li>Valid even where incidental burden on expression is
foreseeable.</li>
<li>Legislative motive rarely fatal if statute is facially neutral.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact &amp; Legacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Forms backbone of <em>symbolic-speech</em> analysis
(flag-desecration, nude-dancing, draft-card possession, mask bans).</li>
<li>Reappears in <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism</em> (1989) &amp;
<em>Turner Broad. v. FCC</em> (1994) as template for tailoring
inquiry.</li>
<li>Modern security-credential laws (airport IDs, badge destruction)
routinely survive under O’Brien.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Socratic Traps &amp; Answers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Q: Could Congress instead criminalize private flag-burning under
O’Brien?</em> → No; ==purpose of reverence for the flag is
<strong>content-related</strong>== → strict scrutiny
(<em>Johnson</em>).</li>
<li><em>Q: If O’Brien had worn the card as an armband?</em> → Mere
display ≠ destruction ⇒ statute not triggered; would fall under pure
speech (strict scrutiny for any content-based ban).</li>
<li><em>Q: Does § 3 interest survive after the draft ends?</em> → Court
defers to Congress’s administrative judgment; future mootness irrelevant
to 1968 conviction.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Q: Would a walkout be protected?</em> → Likely disruptive →

<li><em>Q: Confederate-flag shirts?</em> → Evaluate disruption &amp;

<p>When evaluating whether a law that restricts expressive conduct
violates the First Amendment, courts ask whether the <strong>regulation
is content-based or content-neutral</strong>. The <strong>Selective
Service card-burning case</strong> (<em>United States v. O'Brien</em>,
1968) is the paradigm for content-neutral regulation of conduct. The law
didn’t care <em>why</em> you burned your draft card—it prohibited
destruction of the card to maintain the <strong>functionality of the
Selective Service system</strong>. This purpose was <strong>unrelated to
the message expressed</strong>, so the regulation was upheld under what
became known as the <strong>O’Brien test</strong>, which permits
content-neutral restrictions on expressive conduct if: (1) the
regulation is within the government’s constitutional power, (2) it
furthers an <strong>important or substantial governmental
interest</strong>, (3) the interest is <strong>unrelated to the
suppression of expression</strong>, and (4) the restriction is no
<strong>greater than necessary</strong> to further that interest.</p>
<p>By contrast, <strong>flag-burning prohibitions</strong> that punish
only <strong>protest-based or offensive uses</strong>, as in <em>Texas
v. Johnson</em> (1989), are <strong>content-based</strong>. The law at
issue didn’t ban all flag burning—it criminalized <strong>expressive
flag desecration</strong>, i.e., burning with the intent to criticize or
offend. This meant the state’s action depended on <strong>what the
speaker was trying to say</strong>—a textbook violation of
<strong>viewpoint neutrality</strong> and a trigger for <strong>strict
scrutiny</strong>, which the law failed.</p>
<p>In <em>Morse v. Frederick</em> (2007), the Court allowed a school to
discipline a student for unfurling a “BONG HiTS 4 JESUS” banner at a
school event. While the decision acknowledged that student speech is
protected under <em>Tinker</em>, it carved out an exception for speech
seen as promoting illegal drug use. The ruling was widely criticized for
being <strong>content-based</strong>, though the Court tried to frame it
as a school-based regulation of <strong>illegal advocacy</strong>, not
viewpoint discrimination. It shows how <strong>context and institutional
setting</strong>—here, the <strong>school environment</strong>—can
sometimes skew doctrinal application.</p>
<p>Turning to <strong>forum doctrine</strong>, <em>International Society
for Krishna Consciousness v. Lee</em> (1992) addressed <strong>airport
terminals</strong>, where the Court held that <strong>solicitation could
be banned</strong> because the space was a <strong>nonpublic
forum</strong>, not traditionally open to expressive activity. However,
it did allow <strong>distribution of literature</strong>, highlighting
the subtlety of <strong>permissible regulation in limited
spaces</strong>. The test here focuses on
<strong>reasonableness</strong> and <strong>viewpoint
neutrality</strong>, not strict scrutiny, because the government has
more control over nontraditional forums.</p>
<p>In <em>Burson v. Freeman</em> (1992), the Court upheld a law banning
electioneering within 100 feet of polling places. Although the law was
<strong>content-based</strong>—targeting <strong>political
speech</strong>—it survived <strong>strict scrutiny</strong> due to the
<strong>compelling state interest</strong> in protecting
<strong>electoral integrity and voter privacy</strong>. This case is an
example of <strong>content-based speech restrictions</strong> that
<em>can survive</em>, but only when the <strong>justification is
compelling</strong> and the law is narrowly tailored.</p>
<p>Lastly, obscenity law remains an outlier. In <em>Roth v. United
States</em> (1957), the Court first held that <strong>obscenity is not
protected speech</strong> under the First Amendment. This was later
refined by the infamous plurality in <em>Jacobellis v. Ohio</em> (1964),
where Justice Stewart declined to define hardcore pornography but
famously said, <strong>“I know it when I see it.”</strong> That phrase
encapsulates the <strong>subjectivity and instability</strong> of
obscenity doctrine, which has often invited criticism for its
<strong>moralistic</strong> and <strong>inconsistent</strong>
enforcement, though it remains technically valid law under the
<strong>Miller test</strong> today.</p>
<p>Together, these cases illuminate the delicate—and often
contradictory—line the Court tries to draw between <strong>conduct and
expression</strong>, <strong>protected and unprotected
categories</strong>, and the <strong>forum-based flexibility</strong> of
speech rights. The critical inquiry always turns on the same few pivots:
<strong>is the law regulating the message or the medium</strong>, and
<strong>is the restriction justified independent of suppressing
expression</strong>? The more a law relies on assessing <strong>the
meaning</strong> behind a speaker’s act, the more likely it is to run
afoul of the First Amendment.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>After <em>Minersville v. Gobitis</em> (1940):</strong> West
Virginia amended its statutes to mandate courses in patriotism and—by
<strong>Board resolution (Jan 9 1942)</strong>—a daily flag-salute for
<em>all</em> public-school pupils. Non-compliance =
<strong>“insubordination,”</strong> punished by
<strong>expulsion</strong>; truancy statutes exposed parents to
<strong>$50 fine / 30 days jail</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses</strong> (Barnette family et al.) refuse
on biblical grounds (Exodus 20:4-5). Children expelled; parents
threatened with delinquency charges.</li>
<li>Suit in <strong>U.S. District Court (S.D. W.Va.)</strong> seeks
injunction under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Three-judge court grants relief;
state appeals directly to SCOTUS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>State’s Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>National-unity imperative</strong>: Flag salute vital to
inculcate civic cohesion (borrowing <em>Gobitis</em> language).</li>
<li>Salute is <em>conduct</em>, not protected speech; even if speech,
school officials may set curriculum prerequisites.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Barnette’s Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Flag salute is <strong>symbolic expression</strong>; compelled
affirmation violates both speech and free-exercise guarantees.</li>
<li>Regulation is <strong>viewpoint-specific</strong>—government
dictating orthodox belief.</li>
<li>No “clear &amp; present danger” from silent non-participants.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Issues Presented</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does the First Amendment forbid states from <strong>compelling
students to salute the flag and recite the Pledge</strong> as a
condition of attending public school?</li>
<li>Does the interest in <strong>national unity</strong> justify
compulsion?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>6 – 3</strong>. <strong>Jackson, J.</strong> (Stone C.J.,
Black, Douglas, Murphy, Roberts concurring) reverses; mandatory salute
<strong>unconstitutional</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Dissent:</strong> <strong>Frankfurter, J.</strong> (joined
by Roberts &amp; Reed).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Reasoning (Jackson)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Speech vs. Conduct</strong> – A salute is “a form of
utterance. Symbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating
ideas.”</li>
<li><strong>Compulsion &gt; Suppression</strong> – Forcing
<em>affirmation</em> intrudes more deeply than silencing dissent; no
=="clear and present danger"== justifies it.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed-Star Maxim</strong> – “<em>If there is any fixed star
in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official … can
prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or
other matters of opinion.</em>”</li>
<li><strong>Majoritarianism rejected</strong> – Rights are withdrawn
“from the vicissitudes of political controversy.”</li>
<li><strong>Overrules <em>Gobitis</em></strong> – Courts, not transient
legislatures, guard fundamental liberties.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Frankfurter Dissent (highlights)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Judicial restraint: ==curriculum choices lie with elected bodies;==
Court improperly substitutes its judgment.</li>
<li>Predicts civic disorder if ==courts become “school boards.”==</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compelled-Speech Doctrine</strong>: Government may not force
affirmation of belief.</li>
<li>Introduces modern <strong>symbolic-speech</strong> analysis (later
used in <em>Wooley</em>, <em>Hurley</em>, <em>Janus</em>).</li>
<li>Distinguishes <em>instruction</em> (permissible) from <em>confession
of faith</em> (impermissible).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact &amp; Legacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flag-salute mandates nationwide invalidated.</li>
<li>Serves as cornerstone for refusals to display messages
(<em>Wooley</em>), to fund speech (<em>Pacific Gas</em>), and to join
unions (<em>Janus</em>).</li>
<li>Elevated Justice Jackson’s reputation for eloquent civil-liberties
prose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Socratic Traps &amp; Answers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Could a <em>voluntary</em> patriotic ceremony be
required for extracurricular participation?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes—<em>voluntary</em> participation avoids
coercion; state just can’t <em>compel</em> attendance or
expression.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> May schools teach the <em>history</em> and
<em>meaning</em> of the flag?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely; informational instruction is
content-neutral pedagogy.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Could the state punish students for
<strong>disrupting</strong> peers’ salute?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes—schools may regulate disruptive conduct without
policing viewpoints.</li>

<strong><em>Pleasant Grove City v. Summum</em>, 555 U.S. 460
(2009)</strong></h3>
<p>— <em>Roberts Court crystallizes the modern
<strong>government-speech</strong> doctrine: permanent park monuments
speak for the sovereign, not for passing citizens</em></p>
<p><strong>Facts &amp; Procedural Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pioneer Park, Pleasant Grove, UT:</strong> a 2.5-acre city
park already displaying fifteen permanent exhibits—including a Ten
Commandments slab donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles in
1971—became the focus of dispute when the religious group
<strong>Summum</strong> twice (2003) petitioned to install its own stone
monument espousing the <strong>“Seven Aphorisms of Summum.”</strong> The
city, invoking unwritten custom limiting monuments to items germane to
local history or long-standing community ties, refused.</li>
<li>A formal policy codifying those criteria followed in 2004; a third
Summum request in 2005 was likewise denied.</li>
<li>Summum sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The District Court sided with
Pleasant Grove; the Tenth Circuit reversed—treating the park as a
traditional public forum and the city’s refusal as impermissible
viewpoint discrimination. SCOTUS granted certiorari.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Petitioners’ (City’s) Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Permanent monuments are government expression.</strong>
Acceptance constitutes the city’s own message, hence immune from Free
Speech Clause constraints.</li>
<li>Even if forum principles applied, physical scarcity and aesthetic
curation justify selective acceptance; strict neutrality would force
either chaos or closure.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Respondent’s (Summum’s) Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Public parks are per se traditional public fora; refusing its
monument while retaining others is viewpoint discrimination.</li>
<li>The city could satisfy equal-treatment obligations through neutral
criteria (e.g., size or safety) rather than content-laden
judgments.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Issues Presented</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does the Free Speech Clause require a municipality to accept a
privately donated <strong>permanent</strong> monument when it has
accepted others?</li>
<li>Are permanent monuments in public parks subject to
<strong>public-forum</strong> analysis—or are they instances of
<strong>government speech</strong> unregulated by the Clause?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>9–0 (Alito, J.)</strong>: Reversed. The display of a
permanent monument in a city park is <strong>government speech</strong>;
therefore, the Free Speech Clause imposes no viewpoint-neutrality
obligation on the city.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Reasoning (Alito)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Historical practice of selective receptivity.</strong>
Governments have long chosen, financed, or accepted monuments to craft
civic identity—Statue of Liberty, Iwo Jima, Vietnam Wall, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution logic.</strong> Observers reasonably associate
an installed monument with the landowner’s voice; selective placement
and perpetual presence convey an official message.</li>
<li><strong>Forum doctrine “out of place.”</strong> Unlike leafleting or
rallies (transitory and multitudinous), land cannot host limitless stone
structures; compelling the city to display every offered monument would
either clutter parks or chill acceptance altogether.</li>
<li><strong>Limits remain.</strong> Government speech must still respect
other constitutional commands (e.g., Establishment Clause), but is
<strong>not</strong> cabined by the Free Speech Clause.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Concurring Perspectives (Highlights)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roberts, C.J. (joined by Scalia &amp; Thomas):</strong>
Emphasizes that the Free Speech Clause “is a limit on government, not a
limit on itself.”</li>
<li><strong>Souter, J.:</strong> Flags future need to distinguish
government speech from government <em>funding</em> of private
speech.</li>
<li><strong>Breyer, J.:</strong> Suggests a functional, not formal,
approach—looking to context and likely attribution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Establishes a bright-line rule: <strong>permanent monuments accepted
for display on government land are government speech</strong>; forum
analysis (public, designated, limited) is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Fortifies the <strong>government-speech shield</strong> later
invoked in <strong><em>Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate
Veterans</em></strong> (2015) to uphold state refusal of specialty
plates bearing Confederate symbols.</li>
<li>Signals that when the state speaks, it may <strong>curate
content</strong>, though that power is tempered by other constitutional
guarantees (e.g., Establishment Clause scrutiny of Ten Commandments
displays).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact &amp; Legacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cities nationwide cite <em>Summum</em> to defend selective monument
policies, art-commission vetoes, and removal or retention of
controversial statuary.</li>
<li>Invigorates scholarly debate over the “democratic accountability”
rationale for shielding government speech from First-Amendment
challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Socratic Traps &amp; Answers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Could Summum insist merely on staging an annual
ceremony beside the Ten Commandments?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes—temporary oral speech remains private expression
in a public forum, subject to standard time-place-manner rules.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Does <em>Summum</em> license cities to censor
hostile leaflets in parks?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> No—the ruling is confined to <strong>permanent
structures</strong> clearly attributed to the government; transient
private speech still enjoys forum protection.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Must the city remove its Ten Commandments slab
after <em>Summum</em> if it fears an Establishment-Clause suit?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Possibly—<em>Summum</em> offers no immunity from
Establishment scrutiny; government speech can still violate the Religion
Clauses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mnemonic</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“<em>SUMMUM</em> stones = <em>State</em> tones—park monuments
speak for the polity, not the passer-by.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong> A permanent monument in a city park
<strong>belongs to the government’s voice</strong>; the Free Speech
Clause does not obligate equal access for competing messages, though
other constitutional constraints may still apply.</p>

<li><strong>Civil Rights Context</strong> – <strong>Speech by

<strong><em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</em>, 376 U.S. 254
(1964)</strong></h3>
<p>— <em>Warren Court constitutionalizes American libel law: only
“<strong>actual malice</strong>” can silence criticism of public
officials</em></p>
<p><strong>Facts &amp; Procedural Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Montgomery, AL (1960):</strong> A full-page advertisement,
“<em>Heed Their Rising Voices</em>,” ran in <em>The New York Times</em>,
soliciting funds for the civil-rights struggle and recounting police
abuses. Several factual details were inaccurate (e.g., students sang the
wrong anthem; King arrested four, not seven, times).</li>
<li><strong>L. B. Sullivan</strong>, elected Commissioner of Public
Affairs (in charge of police), claimed the word “police” implicitly
libeled him. Alabama law treated such words as <strong>libel per
se</strong>—injury, falsity, and malice presumed.</li>
<li>State jury awarded Sullivan <strong>$500,000</strong> against the
Times and four Black clergy signatories; Alabama Supreme Court affirmed.
Cert granted to decide how far the First and Fourteenth Amendments limit
state libel verdicts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Petitioners’ (Times &amp; Clergy) Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Criticism of official conduct on public issues lies at the First
Amendment’s core; l==iability without fault== yields unconstitutional
self-censorship.</li>
<li>Alabama’s doctrine of “presumed malice” inverts the burden of proof,
chilling debate.</li>
<li>Advertisement did not refer to Sullivan “of and concerning” him;
verdict lacks evidentiary basis.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Respondent’s (Sullivan) Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Libelous speech sits outside constitutional protection; states may
set strict liability to vindicate reputational interests.</li>
<li>Errors of fact, even in political ads, forfeit First Amendment
immunity.</li>
<li>Jury reasonably inferred he was targeted as the police
commissioner.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Issues Presented</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What constitutional standard governs defamation suits by
<strong>public officials</strong> over speech about their official
conduct?</li>
<li>Does the First Amendment permit a verdict resting on presumed
falsity and malice, with the burden on defendants to prove truth?</li>
<li>Were the challenged statements “of and concerning” Commissioner
Sullivan?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>9 – 0 (Brennan, J.)</strong>: A public official may recover
for defamatory falsehood relating to official conduct <strong>only by
proving “actual malice”</strong>—knowledge of falsity or reckless
disregard for truth—by “clear and convincing” evidence. Alabama verdict
reversed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Reasoning (Brennan)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Robust public debate imperative.</strong> Democracy demands
“uninhibited, robust, wide-open” criticism of officials—even “vehement,
caustic” attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Error is inevitable</strong> in free discussion; compelling
critics to guarantee truth on pain of ruin chills speech.</li>
<li><strong>Actual-malice rule</strong> balances free debate with
reputational interests, preserving breathing space.</li>
<li>Presumptions of falsity/malice and strict liability conflict with
the First Amendment; evidence also insufficient to show the ad was “of
and concerning” Sullivan.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Concurring Perspectives (Highlights)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black &amp; Douglas:</strong> First Amendment is
absolute—government may never punish criticism of officials, true or
false.</li>
<li><strong>Goldberg (joined by Douglas &amp; Brennan):</strong> “Actual
malice” applies to <em>all</em> speech on public issues, not merely
attacks on officials.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Birth of the <strong>“public-official actual-malice” test</strong>,
later extended to <strong>public figures</strong> (<em>Curtis Publishing
v. Butts</em>, 1967) and limited-purpose figures.</li>
<li>Shifts libel from strict state tort to constitutional domain; states
may not impose presumed damages or punitive awards absent actual
malice.</li>
<li>Establishes <strong>clear-and-convincing-evidence</strong> standard
of proof.</li>

<strong><em>Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham</em>, 394 U.S. 147
(1969)</strong></h3>
<p>— <em>Warren Court strikes down discretionary parade-permit regime:
citizens may ignore a “<strong>prior restraint without
standards</strong>.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Facts &amp; Procedural Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good Friday, April 12, 1963:</strong> Civil-rights leader
<strong>Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth</strong> led 52 Black demonstrators four
blocks from a Birmingham church to protest segregation. Marchers stayed
mostly on sidewalks; no traffic blocked.</li>
<li>They had <strong>no parade permit</strong> under Birmingham Code §
1159, which required written application and allowed the City Commission
to deny permits whenever “public welfare, peace, safety, health,
decency, good order, morals or convenience” so “require.”</li>
<li>Police arrested Shuttlesworth; he was convicted, sentenced to 90
days hard labor + fine. Alabama appellate courts affirmed. SCOTUS
granted cert.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Petitioner’s (Shuttlesworth) Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ordinance is an unconstitutional <strong>prior restraint</strong>:
no narrow, objective standards; grants officials unbridled
discretion.</li>
<li>Where a licensing scheme is facially void, citizens may exercise
First Amendment rights without first applying.</li>
<li>Conviction violates Due Process because ordinance is overbroad and
discriminatorily enforced against civil-rights protesters.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Respondent’s (City) Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Streets are a public resource; permits ensure orderly traffic and
safety.</li>
<li>Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies—could have
applied earlier or pursued judicial review; cannot “self-license.”</li>
<li>Even if parts of ordinance vague, Court should construe it narrowly
or uphold conviction for ==unpermitted use of streets.== ??</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Issues Presented</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does § 1159, vesting permit decisions in officials’ subjective
judgment, constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint?</li>
<li>If a licensing law is unconstitutional on its face, may
demonstrators be punished for marching without obtaining a permit?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>8 – 0 (Stewart, J.)</strong>: Ordinance vests
<strong>“virtually unbridled and absolute power”</strong>—invalid under
First &amp; Fourteenth Amendments. Where a law is so void, citizens may
<strong>ignore it and exercise speech rights with impunity</strong>;
conviction reversed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Reasoning (Stewart)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Precedent forbids permit systems lacking <strong>“narrow, objective,
and definite standards”</strong> (e.g., <em>Staub v. Baxley</em>,
<em>Kunz v. New York</em>). Words like “decency” or “morals” allow
suppression of disfavored ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Prior restraint doctrine:</strong> When the right to speak
hinges on an official’s unguided whim, the scheme is
unconstitutional.</li>
<li>Because Birmingham’s ordinance was facially void, Shuttlesworth was
entitled to disregard it; state may not imprison him for not begging
permission to exercise a constitutional right.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Concurring Perspectives (Highlights)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Harlan, J.:</strong> Agrees ordinance unconstitutional but
emphasizes practical absence of <strong>expedited review</strong>;
without prompt procedure, permit denial effectively final, justifying
civil-rights marchers’ decision to proceed.</li>
<li><strong>White, J. (separate):</strong> Stresses that narrow
traffic-control rules are permissible; defect here is standardless
discretion and discriminatory use.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clarifies that <strong>void-for-vagueness + discretion</strong> in
permit schemes equals facial invalidity.</li>
<li>Establishes citizens’ right to <strong>“ignore”</strong> such
schemes (later cited in <em>Cox v. Louisiana</em> II,
<em>Papachristou</em>).</li>
<li>Signals that permissible parade ordinances must: (a) contain
objective criteria; (b) require prompt decision; (c) allow swift
judicial review.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact &amp; Legacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Became cornerstone for modern <strong>time-, place-, and
manner</strong> licensing jurisprudence; cities now draft detailed,
content-neutral parade rules (attendance caps, insurance, fees) to
survive <em>Shuttlesworth</em> scrutiny.</li>
<li>Frequently invoked in challenges to protest permitting after 9/11
and during Black Lives Matter demonstrations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Socratic Traps &amp; Answers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> City ordinance now denies permits for any march
criticizing police during rush hour—valid?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Likely invalid: content-based and vested in official
discretion, violating <em>Shuttlesworth</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> If city had fixed standards (route capacity,
safety) and offered 48-hour review, could it punish marchers without a
permit?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes—constitutionally tailored scheme; protestors
must comply or face civil penalties.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Does <em>Shuttlesworth</em> forbid permit
fees?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> No—reasonable, content-neutral fees tied to
administrative costs are permissible (<em>Forsyth County v. Nationalist
Movement</em>, 1992).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mnemonic</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“<em>SHUTTLES</em> can <em>WORTHily</em> launch without a
license when officials steer by whim.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong><br />
A permit system that lets officials veto demonstrations for amorphous
“public welfare” reasons is a <strong>facial prior restraint</strong>;
when such a law controls the streets, demonstrators may march without
papers—and the state <strong>cannot jail them</strong> for exercising
their First Amendment freedoms.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Mnemonic</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“PENTAGON PAPERS: Press Prints, President Protests—Prior
Restraint Falls.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong><br />
Absent an overwhelming, immediate threat proven with specificity, the
Government cannot gag the press before publication—<strong>the First
Amendment’s presumption against prior restraints reigns supreme, even
when classified secrets are at stake</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Libel refers to written or visual defamation—statements made in a
fixed medium like articles, posters, cartoons, or digital images that
injure someone's reputation. Slander refers to spoken
defamation—transient verbal statements that carry the same injurious
effect but are traditionally treated with more evidentiary burden due to
their ephemeral nature.</p>
<p>Prior restraint refers to a government action that prevents speech
from being expressed before it occurs. This is constitutionally
disfavored and subject to the <strong>strictest scrutiny</strong> under
First Amendment doctrine. Unlike punishment <em>after</em> the fact,
prior restraint seeks to <strong>stop the expression from ever reaching
the public</strong>, which courts view as presumptively unconstitutional
unless certain <strong>exacting standards</strong> are met.</p>
<p>The leading case on prior restraint is <strong>Southeastern
Promotions Ltd. v. Conrad (1975)</strong>. In this case, a theater group
sought to present the controversial musical <em>Hair</em> in a municipal
facility but was denied a permit. The Court ruled that this denial
constituted an impermissible prior restraint because the permitting
system lacked procedural safeguards and gave excessive discretion to
officials. The decision clarified the constitutional requirements that
any system of prior restraint must meet.</p>
<p>The Court laid out a <strong>three-part test</strong> for when prior
restraint might be allowed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>There must be an important or compelling governmental
reason</strong> to impose the restraint (e.g., protecting national
security in a narrowly defined context, avoiding imminent incitement to
violence).</li>
<li><strong>The regulatory scheme must contain clear, narrowly drawn,
and objective standards</strong> that leave <strong>little to no
discretion</strong> in the hands of the licensing authority.
Discretionary systems are prone to censorship based on content or
viewpoint.</li>
<li><strong>There must be strong procedural safeguards</strong>,
including:
<ul>
<li>A fair and timely hearing</li>
<li>A quick final decision</li>
<li>Availability of appellate review<br />
These ensure the speaker is not silenced indefinitely while the process
drags on.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In this context, a <strong>first-come, first-served</strong> system
may qualify as a <strong>clear standard</strong> because it minimizes
discretion. If a permit is granted based solely on application timing
and not on content or viewpoint, that suggests neutrality and fairness.
However, the system must be consistently applied and not used to
indirectly suppress certain viewpoints by, for instance, denying access
to unpopular speakers through technicalities.</p>
<p><strong>Judicial injunctions</strong> on speech—court orders
restraining parties from making certain statements—also implicate prior
restraint principles. These are highly controversial because they amount
to <strong>court-imposed censorship</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>collateral bar rule</strong> says that even if an
injunction is later found unconstitutional, it must be obeyed
<strong>until overturned through proper legal channels</strong>.
Disobeying the order can lead to contempt sanctions regardless of its
ultimate validity. This rule creates tension between obeying the law and
protecting expressive freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Judicial "gag orders"</strong> are a form of injunction
usually applied in the context of ongoing trials (e.g., to prevent
pretrial publicity from influencing a jury). These are subject to strict
scrutiny and often invalidated unless they are absolutely necessary and
narrowly tailored.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>declaratory injunction</strong> merely declares the rights
and legal status of the parties—it does not mandate behavior. A full
<strong>injunction</strong>, by contrast, is a coercive court order
requiring or forbidding specific conduct, including expressive acts.
Only the latter triggers prior restraint concerns.</p>
<p>Regarding national security, the Court has repeatedly emphasized that
<strong>broad or vague references to “security” are
insufficient</strong>. In <em>New York Times Co. v. United States
(1971)</em> (the Pentagon Papers case), the government’s attempt to
enjoin publication on national security grounds failed because its
justifications were too general and speculative. The Court held that
security cannot be used as a <strong>blanket justification</strong> for
suppressing speech; it must be <strong>specific, concrete, and
imminent</strong>.</p>
<p>Overall, the doctrine of prior restraint is built on a distrust of
government power to pre-approve speech. The constitutional preference is
always for <strong>post hoc accountability</strong> (e.g., libel suits)
rather than <strong>ex ante censorship</strong>.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Carson v. Makin</p></li>
<li><p>The question of whether <strong>Paid Days Off (PDOs) for
menstrual cramping</strong> violate the <strong>Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment</strong> turns on whether the law classifies
on the basis of sex and, if so, whether it satisfies
<strong>intermediate scrutiny</strong>. Under <em>Craig v. Boren</em>
and reinforced by <em>United States v. Virginia (VMI)</em>, sex-based
classifications must serve an <strong>important governmental
interest</strong> and be <strong>substantially related</strong> to
achieving that interest. The Court in <em>VMI</em> went further and
demanded an <strong>“exceedingly persuasive justification”</strong> for
such sex-based policies. A menstrual PDO policy would likely be viewed
as <strong>facially sex-based</strong>, triggering intermediate scrutiny
automatically. The state might argue it supports <strong>gender equity
in the workforce</strong>, but it must demonstrate that the policy is
<strong>not based on overbroad generalizations</strong> or
<strong>stereotypes</strong> about women’s capacity for work.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From a rational basis lens, this might pass easily, but the real
question is whether it's <strong>sufficiently tailored</strong>. The
tailoring inquiry focuses on <strong>over- and
under-inclusiveness</strong>: is the policy grounded in
<strong>objective medical thresholds</strong> (e.g., base level of
pain), or does it substitute a <strong>moral or social value
judgment</strong> for legal precision? For example, comparing
flu-related medical leave (often permitted with documentation) versus
menstrual pain (often stigmatized or minimized) may raise
<strong>substantive equality concerns</strong>. If a policy gives
<strong>12 days of PDOs for medical reasons</strong> and includes
menstrual pain as one eligible cause, that’s more neutral—but a blanket
carveout or extra leave solely for menstruation may face questions about
<strong>scope, gender exclusivity</strong>, or <strong>economic
impact</strong> (e.g., employer costs, tax implications). Relatedly, the
<strong>tax status of menstrual products</strong> like tampons—often
taxed as luxury items rather than exempt medical goods—raises issues
under <strong>state constitutional equality clauses</strong>. States
like California have cited <strong>state-level Equal Protection</strong>
to prohibit taxing bottled water differently from other health-related
items, hinting at <strong>analogous arguments for menstrual
equity</strong>.</li>
<li>This discussion connects to <strong>Carolene Products Footnote
4</strong>, which suggested that laws targeting <strong>“discrete and
insular minorities”</strong>, especially when involving
<strong>immutable characteristics</strong> (like sex or race), merit
<strong>heightened scrutiny</strong>. This framework could arguably be
extended to menstrual equity under <strong>gender-based immutability
reasoning</strong>. A similar dynamic played out in public reaction to
<strong>Chicago’s soda tax</strong>, where critics argued that the tax
disproportionately impacted low-income communities—highlighting how
<strong>overbreadth and hidden class lines</strong> often permeate
seemingly neutral health regulations. The logic would also map to
<strong>abortion-related taxes or carveouts</strong>: for example,
taxing abortion services while exempting other procedures may present an
<strong>equal protection or undue burden claim</strong>, depending on
the facts.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Shifting to <strong>immigration and speech</strong>, the idea of
<strong>deporting international students</strong> for
<strong>anti-American speech</strong> (e.g., social media posts critical
of U.S. values or DEI discourse) raises grave <strong>constitutional red
flags</strong>. For noncitizens already <strong>physically present in
the U.S.</strong>, including those on F-1 visas tracked by SEVP (Student
and Exchange Visitor Program), any such policy would likely amount to
<strong>viewpoint discrimination</strong>, which is presumptively
invalid under the <strong>First Amendment</strong>. As applied here, it
would require the government to <strong>punish individuals based on the
content of their political beliefs</strong>, triggering <strong>strict
scrutiny</strong> and likely failing due to the absence of a
<strong>compelling interest narrowly tailored</strong> to such speech.
Additionally, due process protections would apply, especially since
<strong>termination of SEVP status</strong> can result in immediate loss
of legal presence and serious immigration consequences. While the
federal government does enjoy broader power at the
border—<strong>keeping people out</strong> via visa restrictions—it
faces <strong>stricter constitutional limits when regulating people
already inside</strong> the U.S. Any such measure would need to grapple
with both <strong>procedural due process</strong> and
<strong>substantive free speech</strong> doctrine.</p></li>
<li><p>On the matter of <strong>foreign affairs and executive
power</strong>, courts have long recognized that the <strong>judiciary
lacks authority to interfere with foreign policy decisions</strong> of
the Executive Branch. This deference is rooted in the <strong>political
question doctrine</strong>, often invoked in cases like <em>Zivotofsky
v. Kerry</em> or <em>Haig v. Agee</em>, where courts defer to the
President’s unique competence in diplomacy and national security.
However, this doesn’t mean the executive power is
<strong>unlimited</strong>—especially where <strong>individual
constitutional rights</strong> are implicated domestically.</p></li>
<li><p>This leads to the final question: if <strong>Canada’s public
discourse</strong> or media turns <strong>hostile to Americans</strong>,
can the U.S. government respond with <strong>travel bans</strong>,
<strong>export controls</strong>, or <strong>digital
censorship</strong>? Constitutionally, such retaliation raises serious
<strong>First Amendment and commerce-related issues</strong>,
particularly if these restrictions are applied
<strong>domestically</strong> or affect <strong>U.S. citizens'
access</strong> to foreign media, platforms, or markets. Even in the
realm of foreign commerce, Congress and the Executive must act within
<strong>enumerated powers</strong> (e.g., Commerce Clause, foreign
affairs), and retaliatory actions cannot violate <strong>constitutional
guarantees</strong>—including free speech, equal protection, or due
process—especially when impacting individuals inside U.S. borders.
Blanket statements about “national security” do not suffice; the
government must provide <strong>specific, imminent, and
concrete</strong> justifications for infringing core liberties. As in
<em>Pentagon Papers</em> or <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em>, <strong>vague
fears of propaganda or foreign hostility</strong> are not enough to
suppress speech or impose sweeping restrictions. The Constitution does
not permit ideological retaliation in the name of geopolitics without
clear, lawful limits.</p></li>

test</strong>.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Facts &amp; Procedural Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pennsylvania “Purchase of Services” Act (1968):</strong>
reimbursed non-public schools—almost all Catholic—for teachers’
salaries, textbooks, and materials in secular subjects (math, modern
languages, science, P.E.). Reimbursements flowed <strong>directly to the
schools</strong>, subject to audits and accounting rules.</li>
<li><strong>Rhode Island Salary Supplement Act (1969):</strong> paid
<strong>15 % salary bonuses directly to teachers</strong> of secular
subjects in qualifying non-public elementary schools—again,
overwhelmingly Catholic. Applicants pledged not to teach religion and to
use only materials approved for public schools.</li>
<li>Taxpayer plaintiffs (including Alton Lemon) alleged violation of
Establishment &amp; Free Exercise Clauses; three-judge district courts
split—Pennsylvania law upheld, Rhode Island law struck. Appeals
consolidated; Supreme Court noted first application of new § 1253 review
route.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Petitioners’ (States) Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Secular purpose:</strong> rescue financially imperiled
private schools providing mandatory secular education, thus easing
public-school overcrowding.</li>
<li><strong>Primary effect neutral:</strong> aid earmarked to
non-religious instruction; explicit bans on religious content safeguard
neutrality.</li>
<li><strong>No excessive entanglement:</strong> audits are routine
fiscal oversight; comparable to health inspections or bus subsidies
already upheld.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Respondents’ (Taxpayers) Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Parochial schools are pervasively sectarian; money is inherently
fungible—state funds inevitably advance religion.</li>
<li>Continuous audits, salary monitoring, and per-pupil cost policing
create intimate church–state supervision—an entanglement the Founders
sought to avoid.</li>
<li>Political divisiveness along religious lines is itself a forbidden
entanglement.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Issues Presented</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do statutes that subsidize secular instruction in church-related
schools violate the Establishment Clause?</li>
<li>What analytic framework governs such church-state aid
questions?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>8 – 0 on rule (Burger, C.J.), 8 – 1 on application (White
dissenting as to Pennsylvania):</strong> Both statutes are
unconstitutional because they <strong>foster “excessive government
entanglement with religion.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Reasoning (Burger)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Synthesizes prior precedents into a <strong>three-pronged
test</strong>: a statute
<ol type="1">
<li>(i) must have a <strong>secular legislative purpose</strong>,</li>
<li>(ii) its <strong>principal or primary effect</strong> must neither
advance nor inhibit religion, and</li>
<li>(iii) it must <strong>avoid excessive government
entanglement</strong> with religion.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Purpose here is secular, and effect arguably neutral,
<strong>but</strong> continuous auditing of school accounts, policing
teacher conduct, and monitoring per-pupil religious expenditures create
pervasive, enduring oversight—<strong>“a relationship pregnant with
dangers”</strong> of church dominance or state censorship.</li>
<li>Cash subsidies risk political factionalism: fights over public funds
will align with sectarian identity, precisely the evil the Clause
anticipates.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Concurring Snapshots</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Douglas:</strong> Once aid flows, fungibility guarantees
advancement of faith; statutes fail all three prongs.</li>
<li><strong>Brennan:</strong> Warns that even “secular” instruction in
parochial schools inevitably transmits religious worldview.</li>
<li><strong>White (partly dissenting):</strong> Would uphold
Pennsylvania plan—sees no greater entanglement than textbook loans in
<em>Allen</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Lemon test”</strong> becomes default metric for
Establishment cases for decades—though later treated as “guidelines,”
not talismanic.</li>
<li>Introduces <strong>entanglement</strong> as distinct from
purpose/effect; recognizes political divisiveness as a constitutional
harm.</li>
<li>Fuels wave of litigation striking or narrowing state-aid schemes

<li>Dooms most direct cash subsidies to parochial schools until voucher
cases (<em>Zelman</em>, 2002) chart a new path via “private

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong><br />
A passive Ten Commandments monument that has quietly stood for decades
among numerous secular tributes on a state-capitol lawn <strong>does not
amount to governmental endorsement of religion</strong>—its
<strong>historical context and absence of coercion</strong> tip the
constitutional balance, illustrating the Court’s shift from rigid
formulas to pragmatic, context-sensitive judgment.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the realm of <strong>First Amendment religion cases</strong>, the
Supreme Court has long struggled to draw a stable line between
<strong>establishment</strong> and <strong>free exercise</strong>,
oscillating between the ideals of <strong>strict separation</strong>,
<strong>neutrality</strong>, and <strong>accommodation</strong>. The
most famous doctrinal test arose in <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971)</em>,
where the Court articulated a three-pronged framework to evaluate
whether government action violates the <strong>Establishment
Clause</strong>: (1) the law must have a <strong>secular legislative
purpose</strong>, (2) its <strong>primary effect must neither advance
nor inhibit religion</strong>, and (3) it must not <strong>foster
excessive government entanglement</strong> with religion. Although never
formally overturned, the <strong>Lemon test</strong> has been
<strong>hollowed out</strong> and increasingly bypassed by the Court in
favor of <strong>neutrality</strong> or <strong>historical practice
tests</strong>.</p>
<p>In <em>Carson v. Makin (2022)</em>, the Court effectively
<strong>rejected Lemon</strong> without saying so outright, holding that
Maine’s exclusion of religious schools from a tuition-assistance program
violated the <strong>Free Exercise Clause</strong>. The ruling embraced
a <strong>neutrality-based approach</strong>, where government
<strong>cannot exclude religious entities</strong> from a public benefit
solely due to their religious status. The shift away from Lemon reflects
what scholars like <strong>Philip Kurland</strong> advocated decades
ago: <strong>formal neutrality</strong>, where the state neither aids
nor targets religion per se, but must remain equidistant from all
beliefs. This approach gained traction in <em>Van Orden v. Perry
(2005)</em>, where a <strong>Ten Commandments monument</strong> on state
capitol grounds was upheld due to its <strong>passive historical
significance</strong>, signaling that <strong>context and
history</strong> matter more than rigid doctrinal tests.</p>
<p>By contrast, the <strong>accommodation/equality
approach</strong>—seen in cases like <em>Lee v. Weisman
(1992)</em>—accepts some government interaction with religion so long as
it does not <strong>coerce participation</strong> or <strong>endorse
religious orthodoxy</strong>. In <em>Lee</em>, the Court invalidated
clergy-led prayers at public school graduations, emphasizing the
psychological pressure on students and reaffirming that the state must
<strong>not organize religious exercises</strong> in public education.
This position reflects the <strong>liberty-centered theory</strong> of
the Establishment Clause: not that religion is dangerous, but that
<strong>state power corrupts voluntary conscience</strong> when it
aligns itself with belief.</p>
<p>Where the <strong>government discriminates among religions</strong>,
or favors one sect over another, the Court applies <strong>strict
scrutiny</strong>—even if it doesn’t always name it as such. Any law
that explicitly prefers Christianity, Judaism, or Islam over others is
presumptively invalid unless it satisfies a <strong>compelling
interest</strong>, which is almost never possible. Importantly, even
when the Court applies the <em>Lemon</em> test, the <strong>first two
prongs functionally mirror strict scrutiny</strong>: if a law lacks a
secular purpose or its primary effect advances religion, then <strong>no
amount of “important government interest” can salvage it</strong>—a
hallmark of <strong>strict scrutiny logic</strong> cloaked in
formalism.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer in public institutions</strong> remains a key
battleground. In <em>Engel v. Vitale (1962)</em>, the Court struck down
the <strong>recitation of a state-composed prayer</strong> in public
schools, declaring it unconstitutional even though students could opt
out. The problem wasn’t coercion—it was the <strong>symbolic union of
church and state</strong>. <em>Wallace v. Jaffree (1985)</em> extended
this to invalidate a <strong>"moment of silence"</strong> in public
schools where the legislative history showed it was intended to
reintroduce prayer. Yet in <em>Marsh v. Chambers (1983)</em>, the Court
upheld <strong>official legislative prayers</strong> at the start of
sessions, noting that such practices were <strong>deeply rooted in
historical tradition</strong>. The key takeaway is that <strong>schools
and students are uniquely vulnerable</strong>, while
<strong>legislatures composed of adults and elected officials</strong>
are given more leeway under the <strong>historical-practice
exception</strong>.</p>
<p>The symbolic use of religious imagery, such as the <strong>Christian
cross</strong>, continues to provoke disagreement. In public settings, a
cross may be challenged as an <strong>endorsement of religion</strong>,
but the <strong>context matters</strong>. For example, a cross-shaped
<strong>tombstone</strong> marking a soldier’s grave may be seen as a
<strong>personal religious symbol</strong> rather than state
endorsement. Justice <strong>Scalia</strong>, in oral arguments and
dissents, often criticized excessive sensitivity to such displays,
suggesting that <strong>not all religious symbols are coercive</strong>
or unconstitutional. This theme reappears in <strong>Carson v.
Makin</strong>, where the state’s <strong>exclusion of religious
use</strong> (not just religious status) was struck down, further
shifting the balance toward <strong>religious equality in public
funding</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, in broader free speech contexts with national security
implications, your notes reference <em>New York Times Co. v. United
States (1971)</em>—the <strong>Pentagon Papers case</strong>. While the
per curiam opinion blocked the government's attempt to impose
<strong>prior restraint</strong> on publication, the <strong>concurrence
by Justice Stewart</strong> (joined by Justice White) warned of the real
risks of secrecy and emphasized the <strong>press’s structural
role</strong> in checking executive abuse. Stewart wrote that “the only
effective restraint upon executive policy and power...may lie in an
enlightened citizenry,” emphasizing that <strong>vague invocations of
“security” cannot justify censorship</strong>. This ties back to
religious liberty and free speech: the government cannot rely on broad
generalities or unverified fears to justify the suppression or
imposition of belief.</p>
<p>In sum, the Court’s religion doctrine today is a <strong>fragmented
mosaic</strong>: strict scrutiny for religious discrimination, weakened
<strong>Lemon</strong> for establishment cases, a growing tilt toward
<strong>neutrality and accommodation</strong>, and an undercurrent of
concern about <strong>coercion, symbolism, and public
context</strong>.</p>

(1990)</strong></h3>
<p>— <em>Scalia for a 6 – 3 Rehnquist Court narrows Free Exercise:
<strong>Neutral, generally applicable criminal laws need not grant
religious exemptions</strong> (peyote use), overruling Sherbert
balancing outside unemployment-benefit context.</em></p>
<p><strong>Facts &amp; Procedural Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alfred Smith &amp; Galen Black</strong>, counselors at
private rehab clinic, were fired for ingesting peyote during
<strong>Native American Church</strong> sacrament.</li>
<li>Oregon denied unemployment benefits, labeling peyote use
“work-related misconduct.”</li>
<li>Oregon Supreme Court held denial unconstitutional and, on remand,
that Oregon’s peyote ban violated Free Exercise. U.S. Supreme Court
granted cert.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Claimants’ Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Denial of benefits burdens religious practice; under
<strong>Sherbert</strong> test State must show compelling interest.</li>
<li>Oregon historically never prosecuted religious peyote use; exemption
would not undermine drug policy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>State’s Theory</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Uniform enforcement of <strong>Schedule I drug prohibition</strong>
is a neutral, generally applicable criminal law.</li>
<li>Compelling-interest test should not override democratically enacted
laws of general applicability.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does the Free Exercise Clause require a religious exemption from a
neutral, generally applicable criminal drug law?</li>
<li>Must Oregon nonetheless pay unemployment benefits to those fired for
such religiously motivated conduct?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reversed 6 – 3.</strong> Free Exercise does not bar
enforcement of neutral, generally applicable laws; Oregon may deny
benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Reasoning (Scalia)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Historical Rule:</strong> The Constitution protects belief,
not actions violating neutral laws (citing <em>Reynolds</em>
polygamy).</li>
<li><strong>Neutral/Generally Applicable Standard:</strong> Only laws
<strong>aimed at religion</strong> trigger strict scrutiny; otherwise,
rational basis suffices.</li>
<li><strong>Sherbert Limited:</strong> Compelling-interest test confined
to unemployment-benefit cases or <strong>“hybrid” rights</strong>
(religion + speech/parenting).</li>
<li>Warning that universal exemptions would make every citizen “a law
unto himself,” risking anarchy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Concurrence (O’Connor)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Agrees with result but insists <strong>Sherbert</strong> should
remain governing; finds Oregon’s interest compelling here.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dissent (Blackmun, joined by Brennan &amp;
Marshall)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accuses majority of abandoning precedent; argues State failed to
prove compelling interest or show peyote’s religious use harms public
health.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctrinal Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Establishes <strong>Smith rule</strong>: Neutral, generally
applicable laws need no religious exemptions.</li>
<li>Sparks bipartisan backlash → <strong>Religious Freedom Restoration
Act (RFRA) 1993</strong>, reinstating Sherbert test federally; many
<strong>state RFRAs</strong> follow.</li>
<li>Introduces “<strong>hybrid rights</strong>” dicta, seldom applied
with force.</li>
<li>Leaves open strict scrutiny for targeted laws (<em>Lukumi</em>,
1993).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact &amp; Legacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Courts now first ask whether a law is <strong>neutral &amp;
generally applicable</strong>; only then consider compelling-interest
test.</li>
<li>RFRA litigation (e.g., <em>Hobby Lobby</em>, 2014) occupies center
stage where Smith does not control (federal action).</li>
<li>Ongoing debate on scope of neutrality in cases like <em>Fulton v.
Philadelphia</em> (2021).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Socratic Traps &amp; Answers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Would Smith win under federal RFRA today?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Likely yes—RFRA restores strict scrutiny for federal
(not state) law; but Oregon repealed peyote ban for religious use after
the case.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> Are vaccine mandates “neutral and generally
applicable”?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Depends on breadth of secular exemptions;
differential treatment triggers <em>Lukumi</em> strict scrutiny.</li>

<p><strong>Holding &amp; Vote</strong></p>

<li><strong>Q:</strong> May a district now sponsor a student-led prayer

<p>All the cases we’ve discussed—whether on speech, religion, abortion,
guns, or immigration—are ultimately <strong>value-laden
judgments</strong>, even if they’re cloaked in legal methodology. They
reflect deeper tensions between <strong>judicial discretion and
legislative authority</strong>, between <strong>majoritarianism</strong>
(i.e., democratic deference) and <strong>anti-majoritarianism</strong>
(i.e., constitutional checks). The <strong>boundary between
constitutional interpretation and policy-making</strong> is not fixed;
it is historically contingent, deeply ideological, and often
politicized. This is especially evident in the current debates around
the <strong>Second Amendment</strong>, where conflicting methodologies
yield starkly different outcomes on the scope of gun rights.</p>
<p><strong>Originalism as a Mode of Constitutional
Interpretation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supporters argue:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It reflects <strong>fidelity to the constitutional text and
intent</strong> of the Framers.</li>
<li>It <strong>restrains judicial overreach</strong>, preserving
democratic legitimacy.</li>
<li>It allows the Constitution to evolve through <strong>formal
amendment</strong>, not judicial fiat.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Critics respond:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>"dead hand" problem</strong>: Why should the moral and
political judgments of 1789 control us today?</li>
<li><strong>Ambiguity in abstraction</strong>: Phrases like "cruel and
unusual punishment" or "arms" require <strong>interpretive
flexibility</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Tensions between amendments and with stare decisis</strong>:
For example, how do you reconcile the First and Second Amendments in
light of modern public safety concerns?</li>
<li><strong>Is originalism itself even “originalist”?</strong> The
method was not dominant in early American jurisprudence.</li>
<li>Uncertainty about <strong>what counts as originalism</strong>: Is it
<strong>original intent</strong> (the subjective mindset of the Framers)
or <strong>original public meaning</strong> (how a reasonable observer
at the time would have understood the text)?</li>
<li>Increasing <strong>critiques from historians</strong>, especially
regarding selective readings of founding-era sources and reliance on
contested 18th-century practices.</li>
<li>What happens when <strong>multiple plausible
interpretations</strong> exist? Choosing one often involves a
<strong>value judgment</strong>, even if it’s disguised as neutral
historical analysis.</li>

<hr />
<p><strong>Incorporation</strong> is the legal doctrine by which most of
the <strong>first eight amendments</strong> have been applied to the
<strong>states</strong> through the <strong>Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment</strong>. The leading test for whether a right is
incorporated asks whether it is <strong>“fundamental to our scheme of
ordered liberty”</strong> and <strong>“deeply rooted in this nation’s
history and tradition.”</strong> This framework, developed in cases like
<em>Palko v. Connecticut</em> and refined in <em>Duncan v.
Louisiana</em>, has led to the incorporation of nearly all the Bill of
Rights—but with a few <strong>notable exceptions</strong>.</p>
<p>Among the <strong>non-incorporated rights</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Third Amendment</strong>’s prohibition on quartering
soldiers,</li>
<li>The <strong>Grand Jury Indictment Clause of the Fifth
Amendment</strong>, and</li>
<li>The <strong>Seventh Amendment</strong>’s right to jury trials in
civil cases.<br />
These remain enforceable <strong>only against the federal
government</strong>, not the states.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, <strong>reverse incorporation</strong> refers to the
application of the <strong>Equal Protection Clause</strong>—which
formally applies to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment—to the
<strong>federal government</strong>, via the <strong>Fifth Amendment’s
Due Process Clause</strong>. This innovation, first articulated in
<em>Bolling v. Sharpe (1954)</em> (the companion case to <em>Brown v.
Board of Education</em>), held that <strong>equal protection
principles</strong> must logically bind <strong>all government
actors</strong>, regardless of textual placement. It is a functional, if
constitutionally unorthodox, solution to the need for symmetry in civil
rights enforcement.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s Second Amendment jurisprudence reflects these
themes vividly. In <em>District of Columbia v. Heller (2008)</em>, the
Court struck down D.C.’s handgun ban and held that the Second Amendment
protects an <strong>individual right to possess firearms</strong>,
independent of militia service. The opinion leaned heavily on
<strong>original public meaning</strong>, although Justice Scalia’s
majority reasoning was criticized for being both <strong>historically
selective</strong> and <strong>functionally aligned with conservative
policy preferences</strong>. Two years later in <em>McDonald v. City of
Chicago (2010)</em>, the Court applied this individual right to the
states through incorporation, marking a decisive expansion of Second
Amendment protections.</p>
<p>The most recent watershed decision, <em>New York State Rifle &amp;
Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022)</em>, abandoned the <strong>two-step
scrutiny framework</strong> used by most lower courts and instead
mandated a <strong>“history-and-tradition” test</strong>: modern gun
regulations are only constitutional if they are <strong>consistent with
the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation</strong>. This
effectively embedded a strong version of originalism into the doctrine,
sidelining the kind of <strong>means-end balancing</strong> (e.g.,
intermediate scrutiny) that courts had previously used to weigh public
safety against individual gun rights.</p>
<p>In the wake of <em>Bruen</em>, courts are now grappling with how to
assess contemporary regulations using analogies to 18th- or 19th-century
laws. A striking example is <em>United States v. Sing Ledezma</em> (W.D.
Tex. 2023), in which a district court evaluated whether certain firearms
possession restrictions for noncitizens could survive under the
<strong>Bruen test</strong>. The court found <strong>insufficient
historical precedent</strong> to uphold the restriction, thereby
invalidating the statute. The case exemplifies how <strong>post-Bruen
adjudication</strong> is driven not by contemporary policy concerns, but
by a contested inquiry into <strong>historical analogues</strong>, often
interpreted through a selective and ideologically charged lens.</p>
<p>This trend highlights a deeper constitutional conflict: should the
judiciary act as a <strong>historian’s tribunal</strong>, or should it
remain sensitive to <strong>modern realities</strong>—such as mass
shootings, urban violence, and police authority? The Second Amendment
thus becomes a prism through which broader questions emerge:
<strong>What is the role of the courts in a democracy?</strong> How do
we balance individual liberty with collective security? And can
historical analogies deliver constitutional clarity, or are they simply
another vehicle for <strong>judicial value judgments</strong> cloaked in
the language of fidelity to the past?</p>

<p>The <strong>voting paradox</strong> you raise in incorporation
jurisprudence is not merely a theoretical puzzle; it cuts to the core of
<strong>judicial legitimacy</strong> and the mechanics of constitutional
meaning. Consider <em>McDonald v. City of Chicago</em>: the vote to
incorporate the Second Amendment was <strong>fractured</strong>, not
along outcome, but <strong>doctrinal justification</strong>. You had
<strong>five justices agreeing on the result</strong>—that the right
should be incorporated—but <strong>not on the route taken</strong>.</p>
<p>Four justices relied on the <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>—an
already doctrinally convoluted device for importing substantive rights
into state-level constraints. Justice Thomas, alone, grounded
incorporation in the <strong>Privileges or Immunities Clause</strong>,
which has been moribund since <em>The Slaughterhouse Cases</em>. The
outcome was 5–4 for Due Process, but 8–1 against using Privileges or
Immunities. The result: the Second Amendment was incorporated, but
without any <strong>doctrinal majority</strong> on <em>how</em>. There
is no controlling opinion on rationale. This is your paradox.</p>
<p>The <strong>problem</strong>—a doctrinally rootless judgment—is not
an aberration; it’s structural. Under <strong>Marks v. United
States</strong>, the Court sometimes tries to extract the “narrowest
grounds” for controlling doctrine. But that only works in one dimension.
Incorporation is not one-dimensional. <strong>Thomas’s opinion</strong>
introduces a <strong>second dimension</strong>—a structural claim about
federalism and post-Civil War constitutional design. That second axis
invalidates the idea that we can simply triangulate a “median opinion.”
When a two-dimensional split occurs, <strong>there is no narrowest
ground</strong>—only a <strong>coincidence of votes</strong>. As a
result, incorporation survives as a <strong>practice</strong>, but not
as a theory.</p>
<p>This matters because incorporation is <strong>law by
repetition</strong>, not by logic. Today, 99% of incorporated rights
pass through the <strong>Due Process Clause</strong>, despite how
logically foreign “due process” is to the content of those rights. “Due
process” was procedural; we’ve turned it into a <strong>constitutional
suitcase</strong>, packed with whatever the Court wants to smuggle in.
And the judiciary is aware of this. Most justices know they’re working
backward from intuition—<strong>fundamental to our system of
justice</strong>—but they package that intuition in historicist garb. In
that way, <strong>originalism becomes results-oriented</strong> even as
it denies the charge.</p>
<p>Now, stepping back from doctrine to something far more
important—<strong>what separates good from exceptional</strong> in this
field. In my four decades teaching constitutional law, I’ve seen the
full spectrum: clerks to Justices, appellate litigators, public
defenders, prosecutors, policy advisors, and many fine lawyers who had
no taste for courtrooms but shaped doctrine through paper. The
difference is <strong>never</strong> just grades. It’s not GPA. It’s not
a trophy brief. The singular defining trait is ==the <strong>capacity
for rigorous, persuasive writing</strong>—clarity, concision,
precision.== Not legalese. Not verbosity. <strong>Controlled argument.
Intellectual pressure. Sentence-by-sentence clarity.</strong> If you can
write a motion or a memo that a judge reads once and instantly gets, you
are already ahead of 90% of lawyers.</p>
<p>There’s a myth that oral advocacy is the gold standard. It isn’t.
Most of constitutional litigation happens on paper. I’ve known students
who dreaded moot court, who ==<strong>never spoke in class</strong>==,
and who went on to write opinions cited by the Court. Why? Because they
could write with force. So yes, take every writing class you can. Find
instructors who will <em>bleed on your drafts</em>. Make yourself
uncomfortable in your revision process. That’s how you go from a 90 to a
100 in the space where most people settle for 95. If your writing is
<strong>predictable, organized, and intellectually
dangerous</strong>—you will be trusted. And that trust is
everything.</p>
<p>Finally, your path—starting with watching court, falling into con law
doctrine, and moving into criminal defense—is <em>exactly</em> the path
that reveals the <strong>moral weight of constitutional law</strong>.
The Constitution isn’t just a text; it’s the line between liberty and
power. Criminal defense work will teach you procedural integrity.
Prosecutorial work, if you pursue it next, will teach you discretion and
restraint. By the time you apply to law school, you won’t just have
experiences—you’ll have an <strong>internalized ethical
architecture</strong>, which will set you apart.</p>
<p>And yes, of course you can reach out. Any student who thinks as
carefully and writes as critically as you already earns my respect. If,
in two years, you still believe law is your path—and if your writing
reflects the same fire as your thinking—I would be honored to write on
your behalf. You don’t owe me perfection. You owe the profession your
<strong>rigor</strong>.</p>
<p>And I trust that you will deliver.</p>
